## v2.5.1 — February 15, 2026

Patch release focused on stability and polish after v2.5.0.

### Improved
- Reliability fixes across session lifecycle and hook integration paths.
- Minor CLI UX refinements and output consistency improvements.

### Fixed
- Follow-up fixes for v2.5.0 project/injection workflows.
- Documentation alignment with live CLI behavior and flags.

---

## v2.5.0 — February 15, 2026

Two headline features that change how agents interact with their vaults.

### 🧠 Dynamic Prompt Injection

New `clawvault inject` command pulls relevant decisions, preferences, and rules directly into prompt context. Two-layer matching:

1. **Deterministic matching** (default) — keyword and scope-based rules, zero latency
2. **LLM fuzzy matching** (opt-in `--enable-llm`) — classifies message intent, finds relevant vault entries

```bash
clawvault inject "How should we handle the Hale deployment?"
clawvault inject --enable-llm "What's our pricing strategy?"
```

### 📁 First-Class Project Primitive

`clawvault project` with full lifecycle: `add`, `update`, `archive`, `list`, `show`, `tasks`, `board`.

```bash
clawvault project add "Site Machine" --owner pedro --client "Hale Pet Door" --status active
clawvault project tasks site-machine
clawvault project board --group-by client
```

Projects link to tasks, generate Obsidian Kanban boards, and support filtering by status/owner/client.

### Also Added
- **Pluggable compression backends** — Ollama, Minimax, GLM, any OpenAI-compatible backend.
- **Centralized transition logging** — task state changes write to `transitions.jsonl` ledger.

### Improved
- Canvas refactored to single generator (-2,081 lines).
- LLM matching in inject disabled by default (deterministic-only unless `--enable-llm`).
- Test suite: **429 tests across 64 files**.

### Fixed
- Ledger write failures no longer crash task updates.
- Task list metadata visibility preserved.
- Docs: 25 URL redirects for broken/guessable links.
- Docs: Corrected `wake` command flags.

---

## v2.4.6 — February 14, 2026

### Added
- **Enriched task frontmatter** — tasks now support `due`, `tags`, `description`, `estimate`, `parent`, and `depends_on`.
- **Task filters** — `clawvault task list` now supports `--due`, `--tag`, and `--overdue`.
- **`clawvault kanban sync`** — generates an Obsidian Kanban board from current task state.
- **`clawvault kanban import`** — reverse-syncs board edits back into task frontmatter files.

### Improved
- Test suite expanded to **413 passing tests across 60 files**.

---

## v2.4.5 — February 14, 2026

### Added
- **`clawvault config get/set/list/reset`** — runtime config management.
- **`clawvault recover --check`** — non-destructive dirty death flag inspection.
- **`clawvault recover --list`** — checkpoint history listing.
- **`clawvault route add/remove/list/test`** — custom entity routing rule management.

### Fixed
- Strip qmd stdout noise before JSON parsing (PR #14, thanks @jbencook).

---

## v2.4.4 — February 14, 2026

### Added
- **Task State Transition Ledger** — every task status change emits a typed JSONL event to `ledger/transitions/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` with `task_id`, `agent_id`, `from_status`, `to_status`, `timestamp`, `confidence`, `cost_tokens`, and `reason`.
- **`clawvault task transitions [task_id]`** — query transition history with `--agent`, `--failed`, and `--json` filters.
- **`--confidence` and `--reason` flags** on `task update` and `task done` commands.
- **Regression detection** — flags backward transitions (done→open, done→blocked, in-progress→blocked).
- **Auto-escalation** — tasks with 3+ blocked transitions automatically get `escalation: true` in frontmatter.
- **`clawvault blocked --escalated`** — filter for escalated tasks only.

---

## v2.4.3 — February 14, 2026

### Changed
- Updated npm description and keywords to reflect v2.4.x features (context profiles, canvas dashboards, neural themes).

---

## v2.4.2 — February 14, 2026

### Fixed
- **`--minimal` flag** now correctly skips tasks, bases, and graph via new `initFlags` parameter in `vault.init()` and `createVault()`.
- **`--categories` flag** passes custom category list through to `createVault()` correctly.
- **`--no-bases` flag** wired through `initFlags.skipBases` in `vault.init()`.
- **Existing vault detection** — `init` now errors with "A ClawVault already exists" instead of silently overwriting.
- **Welcome note guard** — `createWelcomeNote()` checks `this.config.categories.includes('inbox')` before writing.
- **Bases guard** — `createBasesFiles()` only runs when `this.config.categories.includes('tasks')`.
- All init options (`--minimal`, `--categories`, `--no-bases`, `--no-tasks`, `--no-graph`, `--canvas`, `--theme`, `--name`) fully wired in CLI registration.

---

## v2.4.1 — February 14, 2026

### Changed
- **README rewritten** from scratch (~6.5KB) to reflect v2.4.x features.
- **Package metadata** updated — new description, keywords for context profiles, canvas dashboards, neural themes.

---

## v2.4.0 — February 14, 2026

### Added
- **Brain Architecture Canvas** — `clawvault canvas --template brain` generates a 4-quadrant system overview: Hippocampus (vault structure + content flow), Direction (stats + decisions), Agent Workspace (active/blocked/backlog), and Knowledge Graph (stats + top entities + category bars).
- **Owner-Centric Project Board** — `clawvault canvas --template project-board` redesigned with status columns, priority icons, owner cards (🤖 agents / 👤 humans), and backlog grouped by project.
- **Canvas Customization** — new flags: `--owner` (filter by owner), `--width`/`--height` (dimensions), `--include-done` (show completed tasks), `--list-templates`.
- **Setup Command Overhaul** — `clawvault setup` now supports `--theme neural|minimal|none`, `--graph-colors`/`--no-graph-colors`, `--bases`/`--no-bases`, `--canvas [template]`, `--force`, and `-v --vault`.
- **Init Command Flags** — `--no-bases`, `--no-tasks`, `--no-graph`, `--categories <list>`, `--canvas <template>`, `--theme`, `--minimal` for full customization of new vaults.
- **Neural Graph Theme** — dark background, colored nodes by category/tag, green neural-network links, golden glow on focused nodes. Applied via CSS snippet + Obsidian graph.json colorGroups.
- **Obsidian Bases Views** — 5 auto-generated `.base` files on setup/init: all-tasks, blocked, by-project, by-owner, backlog.

### Fixed
- Date handling for bare dates in frontmatter — `blocked`, `backlog list`, and canvas templates no longer crash on Date objects.

### Changed
- Default setup theme is `neural`.
- Brain canvas uses grouped architecture layout (was radial).
- Project board uses text cards with owner/priority metadata (was file nodes).

---

## v2.3.1 — February 14, 2026

### Added
- **WebDAV server for Obsidian mobile sync** — `clawvault serve` now supports WebDAV on `/webdav/` for [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save) over Tailscale. Supports GET, PUT, DELETE, MKCOL, PROPFIND, OPTIONS, HEAD, MOVE, and COPY.

### Improved
- Tailscale server module refactored for WebDAV route integration.
- 51 new WebDAV tests (553 total passing).

---

## v2.3.0 — February 14, 2026

### Added
- **Task management** — `clawvault task` with `add`, `list`, `update`, `done`, and `show`.
- **Backlog management** — `clawvault backlog` with `add`, `list`, and `promote`.
- **Blocked view** — `clawvault blocked` for quick triage of blocked work.
- **Canvas dashboard** — `clawvault canvas` generates an Obsidian JSON Canvas dashboard.
- **Vault activity stats in canvas** — observation/reflection/task/session/document metrics included in generated dashboard.
- **Tailscale networking** — `clawvault serve`, `clawvault peers`, and `clawvault net-search` for multi-vault collaboration.
- **New default categories** — `lessons`, `agents`, `commitments`, `handoffs`, `research`, `tasks`, `backlog` (16 total, up from 9).
- **Ledger structure in init** — `clawvault init` now creates `ledger/raw/`, `ledger/observations/`, `ledger/reflections/` from day one.
- **Welcome note** — new vaults get a welcome note in `inbox/` with quick-start commands.

### Improved
- Init output shows memory categories, work categories, and ledger structure separately.
- Post-init instructions link to docs.clawvault.dev.
- Canvas layout engine with proper positioning, grouping, and color coding per JSON Canvas spec.

---

## v2.2.0 — February 14, 2026

### Added
- **Ledger-first observer architecture** — raw transcripts preserved in `ledger/raw/<source>/` as the canonical source of truth. Compiled observations are derived views in `ledger/observations/YYYY/MM/DD.md`.
- **Scored importance model** — replaces emoji priorities with typed, scored format: `[type|c=confidence|i=importance]`. Types: decision, preference, fact, commitment, milestone, lesson, relationship, project.
- **`clawvault reflect`** — promotes stable observation patterns into weekly reflections (`ledger/reflections/YYYY-WNN.md`). Can be scheduled via cron or run manually.
- **`clawvault replay`** — ingest historical exports from ChatGPT, Claude, OpenCode, or OpenClaw into the observation pipeline.
- **`clawvault rebuild`** — regenerate compiled observations from raw ledger transcripts.
- **`clawvault archive`** — move old observations to `ledger/archive/` (default 14 days retention).
- **`clawvault migrate-observations`** — convert legacy emoji observations to scored format with non-destructive backups.
- **`clawvault sync-bd`** — optional Beads task sync into `views/now.md`.
- **Graph guardrails** — `--max-hops` on context command (default 2), derived-only nodes (no synthetic nodes for missing files), archive paths excluded from search/graph.
- **`sleep --reflect`** option runs reflection pass after handoff.

### Improved
- Context profiles use importance buckets (structural/potential/contextual) instead of color names.
- Tight-budget context preserves at least one top-ranked signal.
- Observation reader supports both ledger and legacy paths with automatic deduplication.

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing emoji observations remain fully readable. New pipeline emits scored lines only.
- `migrate-observations` provides a safe one-way migration with `.emoji-backup.md` files.

---

## v2.1.2 — February 13, 2026

### Improved
- **Observation compressor now captures business milestones** — not just code. Client demos, pricing decisions, strategy pivots, signed contracts, pitch decks, and proposals are now treated as first-class project milestones alongside version releases and PR merges.
- Priority enforcement rules updated: completed demos and pricing decisions are always critical (red), proposals and deploys are always notable (yellow).

---

## v2.1.1 — February 13, 2026

### Improved
- **Compressor priority rules for project milestones** — version releases, PR merges, and shipped features are now enforced as critical observations. Deploys and new commands are enforced as notable. Previously these were marked as low-priority info and often dropped during compression.

---

## v2.1.0 — February 13, 2026

### Added
- **Active Session Observer** — `clawvault observe --active` incrementally observes long-running OpenClaw sessions without waiting for them to go stale.
- **Smart threshold triggers** — scaled by session size: &lt;1MB triggers at 50KB new content, 1-5MB at 150KB, &gt;5MB at 300KB.
- **Per-session byte cursors** — tracks observation progress in `.clawvault/observe-cursors.json` so only new transcript deltas are compressed.
- **OpenClaw hook integration** — heartbeat events run cheap `statSync` checks, triggers observation only when thresholds are crossed. Also fires on context compaction and `/new` commands.
- **Source label tagging** — observations are tagged with their origin (telegram-dm, discord, main, etc.) for attribution.
- **Dry-run mode** — `--dry-run` previews which sessions would be observed without compressing.
- **Helper scripts** — `observe-active-sessions.sh` and `observe-stale-sessions.sh` for cron integration.

### Changed
- Extracted `resolveVaultPath` into shared `lib/config.ts` (was duplicated in observe command).
- Created `lib/session-utils.ts` for OpenClaw session discovery utilities.

---

## v2.0.2 — February 13, 2026

### Fixed
- Wiki-link corruption in observe compressor — LLMs were fusing word fragments into wiki-links during compression (e.g., `reque[[people/pedro]]`). Added `sanitizeWikiLinks()` post-processor.

---

## v2.0.1 — February 13, 2026

### Fixed

- ClawHub metadata audit compliance (kind, env\_optional, hooks, capabilities)
- SKILL.md version sync with package.json

---

## v2.0.0 — February 13, 2026

Major release: Memory Graph, Context Profiles, CLI modularization.

### Added

- **Memory Graph Index** — typed knowledge graph (`.clawvault/graph-index.json`) with wiki-link, tag, and frontmatter edges. Schema versioned with incremental rebuild.
- **Graph-Aware Context** — `clawvault context` blends semantic search with graph-neighbor traversal, with explain signals in JSON output.
- **Context Profiles** — `clawvault context --profile` with `default`, `planning`, `incident`, `handoff` presets for task-appropriate context injection.
- **`clawvault compat`** — OpenClaw compatibility diagnostics. Checks hook wiring, event routing, SKILL.md, and handler safety. `--strict` mode for CI.
- **`clawvault graph`** — graph summary and refresh diagnostics.
- **Doctor upgrade** — now includes OpenClaw compatibility check summary.
- **Dashboard upgrades** — vault parser emits typed nodes, typed edges, and type statistics.
- **Hook handler** — flexible event routing via `eventMatches()` and `normalizeEventToken()`, `--profile auto` for context queries.

### Changed

- **CLI modularized** — monolithic `clawvault.js` split into 7 command groups (`register-core`, `register-query`, `register-vault-operations`, `register-maintenance`, `register-resilience`, `register-session-lifecycle`, `register-template`).
- **367+ tests** across core, commands, graph, dashboard, hooks, and CLI registration.

---

## v1.11.2 — February 12, 2026

### Fixed

- **Entity-slug routing** — observations route to entity subfolders (`people/pedro/2026-02-12.md` instead of `people/2026-02-12.md`)
- **Root-level file prevention** — observations never create files at vault root; always route to category folders
- **Entity name extraction** — case-sensitive proper noun matching prevents capturing common words
- **Dedup improvements** — router uses normalized content + Jaccard similarity to prevent duplicates

---

## v1.11.1 — February 11, 2026

### Fixed

- **Compressor priority enforcement** — post-processes LLM output to upgrade misclassified priorities (decisions get critical, preferences get notable)
- **Temporal decay in reflector** — low-priority observations older than 7 days auto-pruned; critical always kept
- **Exec summary in wake** — richer context with observation summaries
- **Dedup normalization** — strips timestamps, wiki-links, and whitespace before comparing

---

## v1.11.0 — February 11, 2026

### Removed
