# Observations

Observations are LLM-compressed summaries of conversation transcripts. They're the bridge between raw chat history and structured memory — the `observe` pipeline reads conversations, extracts what matters, assigns priority, and routes findings to the right vault categories.

## How Observations Work

```
Conversation transcript
        ↓
   observe (LLM compression)
        ↓
   Priority assignment (critical / notable / routine)
        ↓
   Auto-routing to categories (decisions/, lessons/, preferences/, etc.)
        ↓
  Stored in ledger/observations/ with scored frontmatter
```

### The Pipeline

1. **Input**: Raw conversation files (OpenClaw sessions, ChatGPT exports, Claude exports)
2. **Compression**: An LLM reads the conversation and extracts key information — decisions made, lessons learned, preferences stated, commitments given
3. **Priority scoring**: Each observation gets a priority level
4. **Routing**: High-value items are auto-routed to typed categories (decisions, lessons, etc.)
5. **Storage**: The compressed observation lands in `observations/` with frontmatter

## Priority Levels

| Level | Emoji | Meaning | Examples |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| Critical | 🔴 | Must not be lost — decisions, commitments, credentials | "We decided to use JWT tokens", "Pedro wants weekly reports" |
| Notable | 🟡 | Worth remembering — insights, preferences, patterns | "The team prefers async standups", "React Server Components worked well" |
| Routine | 🟢 | Low-value context — general discussion, debugging steps | "Tried three approaches to fix the bug", "Discussed lunch plans" |

## File Structure

Observations are stored in `ledger/observations/YYYY/MM/DD.md`:

title: "Session 2026-02-15 — Auth system redesign"
priority: 8
source: openclaw/clawdious/main
created: 2026-02-15T14:30:00Z
tags: [auth, security, jwt]
---

## Decisions
- Switching from session tokens to JWT for stateless auth
- Using RS256 signing with key rotation every 90 days

## Lessons
- Session-based auth doesn't scale well with multiple agents
- JWT refresh token flow needs careful error handling

## Action Items
- Implement JWT middleware (assigned to clawdious)
- Update auth docs before v2.5 release
```

## CLI Commands

### `observe`

Run the observation pipeline.

```bash
# Watch active OpenClaw sessions
clawvault observe --active

# One-shot compression of a specific file
clawvault observe --compress ~/transcripts/session-2026-02-15.md

# Watch a directory for new files
clawvault observe --watch ~/transcripts/

# Dry run — see candidates without compressing
clawvault observe --active --dry-run

# Run as background daemon
clawvault observe --daemon
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--watch <path>` | Watch a file or directory |
| `--active` | Observe active OpenClaw sessions incrementally |
| `--agent <id>` | OpenClaw agent ID (default: `OPENCLAW_AGENT_ID`) |
| `--min-new <bytes>` | Minimum new-content threshold in bytes |
| `--sessions-dir <path>` | Override OpenClaw sessions directory |
| `--dry-run` | Show candidates without compressing |
| `--threshold <n>` | Compression token threshold (default: 30000) |
| `--reflect-threshold <n>` | Reflection token threshold (default: 40000) |
| `--model <model>` | LLM model override |
| `--compress <file>` | One-shot compression for a single file |
| `--daemon` | Run in detached background mode |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path |

### `reflect`

Promote stable observations into weekly reflections — a higher-level summary of patterns across multiple sessions.

```bash
clawvault reflect
clawvault reflect --days 7
clawvault reflect --dry-run
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--days <n>` | Observation window in days (default: 14) |
| `--dry-run` | Show candidates without writing |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path |

## Auto-Routing

When the observer compresses a conversation, it doesn't just dump everything into `observations/`. High-value items are **routed** to typed categories:

- **Decisions** → `decisions/` (e.g. "We decided to use Postgres instead of MongoDB")
- **Lessons** → `lessons/` (e.g. "Never deploy on Friday without rollback plan")
- **Preferences** → `preferences/` (e.g. "Pedro prefers dark mode in all tools")
- **Commitments** → tasks or `commitments/` (e.g. "I'll have the report ready by Monday")

You can customize routing rules with `clawvault route add`:

```bash
# Route anything mentioning "security" to the decisions category
clawvault route add "security" decisions

# Test a route
clawvault route test "We decided to enable 2FA for all users"
```
