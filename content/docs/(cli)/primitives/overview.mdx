# Primitives

ClawVault organizes agent memory around **typed primitives** — structured data types that each serve a specific role in the observe → store → retrieve cycle.

Every primitive follows the same pattern:

- **YAML frontmatter schema** — structured metadata at the top of a markdown file
- **File location convention** — stored in a specific folder (`tasks/`, `projects/`, `decisions/`, etc.)
- **CLI commands for CRUD** — create, read, update, and delete via the `clawvault` CLI
- **Memory graph integration** — wiki-links (`[[entity]]`) connect primitives to each other
- **Observer routing** — the `observe` pipeline can auto-create primitives from conversation context

## The Six Primitives

| Primitive | Folder | Purpose | Key Commands |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|
| [Tasks](/docs/primitives/tasks) | `tasks/` | Track work items with status, priority, ownership | `task add`, `task list`, `task done` |
| [Projects](/docs/primitives/projects) | `projects/` | Group tasks by project, track team/client/deadline | `project add`, `project list`, `project board` |
| [Observations](/docs/primitives/observations) | `observations/` | LLM-compressed conversation summaries | `observe`, `reflect` |
| [Decisions](/docs/primitives/decisions) | `decisions/` | Structured records of choices made | `store --category decisions`, `remember decision` |
| [Handoffs](/docs/primitives/handoffs) | `handoffs/` | Session transition records for continuity | `sleep`, `wake` |
| [Templates](/docs/primitives/templates) | `templates/` | Reusable markdown templates with frontmatter schemas | `template list`, `template create` |

## How Primitives Fit Together

```
Conversation → observe → Observations (auto-routed)
                              ↓
                    Decisions, Lessons, Preferences (categorized)
                              ↓
User action → task add → Tasks ←→ Projects (linked via --project)
                              ↓
Session end → sleep → Handoffs → wake (session continuity)
```

Primitives are plain markdown files. You can edit them in Obsidian, VS Code, or any text editor — the CLI is just a convenience layer.

## The Observe → Store → Retrieve Cycle

1. **Observe**: The `observe` command watches conversation transcripts and compresses them into prioritized observations
2. **Store**: Observations are auto-routed to the right categories (decisions, lessons, preferences). Tasks and projects are created explicitly via CLI
3. **Retrieve**: `search`, `vsearch`, `inject`, and `context` pull relevant primitives into prompts

Every primitive participates in this cycle. Tasks show up in `context` results. Decisions get injected by `inject`. Observations feed into `reflect` for weekly summaries.

## Wiki-Links and the Memory Graph

All primitives support wiki-links for cross-referencing:

```markdown
---
title: Fix auth bug
project: site-machine
owner: clawdious
---

Related to [[site-machine]] project. Blocked by [[pedro]]'s review.
See [[decision-use-jwt-tokens]] for context.
```

Run `clawvault link --all` to auto-link entity mentions across your vault. Use `clawvault graph` to visualize the connections.

## Memory Types vs. Primitives

[Memory types](/docs/concepts/memory-types) (fact, feeling, decision, lesson, etc.) classify *what kind of knowledge* something is. Primitives define *how that knowledge is stored and managed*. A decision memory type maps to the decisions primitive. A commitment maps to a task. They work together — types classify, primitives structure.
