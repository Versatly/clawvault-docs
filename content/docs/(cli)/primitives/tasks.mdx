# Tasks

Tasks are ClawVault's core work-tracking primitive. Every task is a markdown file in `tasks/` with YAML frontmatter that tracks status, priority, ownership, dependencies, and more.

Why tasks matter for agents: without structured task tracking, work items live only in chat history — which dies with every session. Tasks persist across sessions, are searchable, version-controlled, and visible in Obsidian's Kanban board.

## File Structure

Tasks live in `tasks/<slug>.md`. The slug is auto-generated from the title (lowercased, hyphenated).

```markdown
---
title: Ship onboarding flow
status: in-progress
priority: high
owner: clawdious
project: growth
due: 2026-02-20
tags: [ux, v2.5]
description: Build the new user onboarding wizard
estimate: 4h
parent: null
depends_on: [design-onboarding-screens]
blocked_by: null
created: 2026-02-15T10:30:00Z
confidence: null
reason: null

## Notes

Working on step 1 of the wizard. Need to confirm copy with Pedro.

### `task done`

Mark a task as completed.

```bash
clawvault task done ship-onboarding-flow --reason "Shipped in v2.5.0"
clawvault task done ship-onboarding-flow --confidence 1.0 --reason "All tests passing"
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path |
| `--confidence <value>` | Transition confidence (0–1) |
| `--reason <reason>` | Reason for completion |

### `task show`

Display full task details.

```bash
clawvault task show ship-onboarding-flow
clawvault task show ship-onboarding-flow --json
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

### `task transitions`

View the transition history for tasks. Every status change is logged to `transitions.jsonl`.

```bash
# All transitions
clawvault task transitions

# Transitions for a specific task
clawvault task transitions ship-onboarding-flow

# Filter by agent
clawvault task transitions --agent clawdious

# Show only regressions (e.g. done → open)
clawvault task transitions --failed

# JSON output
clawvault task transitions --json
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path |
| `--agent <id>` | Filter by agent |
| `--failed` | Show only regression transitions |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

## Transition Logging

Every status change is appended to `transitions.jsonl` in your vault root. Each entry records:

```json
{
  "task": "ship-onboarding-flow",
  "from": "open",
  "to": "in-progress",
  "agent": "clawdious",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reason": "Starting implementation",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

This ledger is append-only — it's a full audit trail of every task state change. Use `task transitions --failed` to spot regressions (tasks that went backward, e.g. `done` → `open`).

## Kanban Board Integration

Tasks integrate with Obsidian's Kanban plugin via the [`kanban`](/docs/commands/kanban) command.

### Generate a board from tasks

```bash
# Default board grouped by status
clawvault kanban sync

# Group by project
clawvault kanban sync --group-by project

# Filter to one project
clawvault kanban sync --filter-project growth

# Include completed tasks
clawvault kanban sync --include-done
```

### Import changes from the board

If you drag cards around in Obsidian's Kanban view, import those changes back:

```bash
clawvault kanban import
```

This reads `Board.md` and updates task frontmatter to match the board's lane assignments.

## Common Workflows

### Creating a task with full context

```bash
clawvault task add "Implement JWT auth" \
  --project api-v2 \
  --owner clawdious \
  --priority critical \
  --due 2026-02-18 \
  --tags "security,auth" \
  --description "Replace session tokens with JWT" \
  --estimate 1d \
  --depends-on "design-auth-flow"
```

### Blocking and unblocking

```bash
# Block a task
clawvault task update implement-jwt-auth --status blocked --blocked-by "waiting for security audit"

# Unblock it
clawvault task update implement-jwt-auth --status in-progress --clear-blocked-by --reason "Audit passed"
```

### Subtask hierarchy

```bash
clawvault task add "Ship auth system" --project api-v2 --priority high
clawvault task add "Implement JWT" --parent ship-auth-system --priority critical
clawvault task add "Write auth tests" --parent ship-auth-system --priority high
clawvault task add "Update auth docs" --parent ship-auth-system --priority medium
```

### Quick triage

```bash
# What's overdue?
clawvault task list --overdue

# What's blocked?
clawvault blocked

# What's critical?
clawvault task list --priority critical
```
