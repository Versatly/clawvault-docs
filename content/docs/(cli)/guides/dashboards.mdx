# Canvas & Dashboards

ClawVault generates **Obsidian JSON Canvas** files for visual dashboards, plus text-based summaries and metrics for terminal workflows.

## Canvas Command

```bash
clawvault canvas [options]
```

Generate a visual canvas file that opens in Obsidian's Canvas view:

```bash
# Generate dashboard.canvas in the vault root
clawvault canvas

# Write to a custom output path
clawvault canvas --output boards/dashboard.canvas
```

### Canvas Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--output <path>` | Output file path | `dashboard.canvas` |

## Project and Task Boards

For board-style views, use the dedicated commands:

```bash
# Project board (markdown)
clawvault project board
clawvault project board --group-by client

# Task kanban board (markdown)
clawvault kanban sync
clawvault kanban sync --group-by owner --include-done
```

## Text Dashboard

For terminal-based workflows, `clawvault dashboard` prints a vault summary:

```bash
clawvault dashboard
```

Output:

```
 ClawVault Dashboard — ~/memory

```

## Stats

Get detailed metrics about your vault:

```bash
clawvault stats
```

Shows memory counts by category, task velocity, transition patterns, and storage usage.

## Obsidian Bases as Dashboards

The `.base` files generated by ClawVault act as lightweight dashboards inside Obsidian:

- `all-tasks.base` — sortable/filterable task table
- `blocked.base` — blocked tasks with escalation flags
- `by-project.base` — tasks grouped by project
- `by-owner.base` — tasks grouped by owner
- `backlog.base` — backlog items

These update automatically as you modify task files — no regeneration needed.

<Callout type="info">
Bases views are the easiest way to get a dashboard without leaving Obsidian. For richer visuals, use `clawvault canvas`.
</Callout>

## Neural Graph Theme

ClawVault includes a **neural** theme that styles your Obsidian vault with a graph-inspired aesthetic — dark backgrounds, glowing node connections, and color-coded categories.

Apply during init or setup:

```bash
# During initialization
clawvault init ~/memory --theme neural

# On an existing vault
clawvault setup --theme neural
```

The theme adds CSS snippets and graph view settings to your vault's `.obsidian/` directory.
