# Canvas & Dashboards

ClawVault generates **Obsidian JSON Canvas** files for visual dashboards, plus text-based summaries and metrics for terminal workflows.

## Canvas Command

```bash
clawvault canvas [template] [options]
```

Generate a visual canvas file that opens in Obsidian's Canvas view:

```bash
# Default template
clawvault canvas

# Specific template
clawvault canvas brain
clawvault canvas project-board --project api
clawvault canvas sprint --owner clawdious
```

### Templates

#### `default`

A general-purpose canvas showing vault health, recent activity, and key metrics. Good starting point for any vault.

#### `brain`

The **Brain Architecture** template — a 4-quadrant layout designed for agent workspaces:

| Quadrant | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Hippocampus** (top-left) | Recent memories, daily notes, active context |
| **Direction** (top-right) | Goals, commitments, active projects |
| **Agent Workspace** (bottom-left) | Current tasks, in-progress work, blockers |
| **Knowledge Graph** (bottom-right) | Connected concepts, people, decisions |

```bash
clawvault canvas brain
```

This is the recommended layout for agents using ClawVault as their primary memory system.

#### `project-board`

A **Kanban-style** board with columns for each task status:

- **Todo** — tasks waiting to start
- **In Progress** — active work
- **Review** — awaiting review
- **Blocked** — stuck tasks (highlighted)
- **Done** — completed (opt-in with `--include-done`)

Tasks show priority icons (🔴 critical, 🟠 high, 🟡 medium) and owner cards (🤖 for agents, 👤 for humans).

```bash
clawvault canvas project-board --project api
clawvault canvas project-board --include-done
```

#### `sprint`

A focused view of current sprint work, filtered by owner or project. Shows task counts, completion percentage, and blocked items.

```bash
clawvault canvas sprint --owner clawdious
```

### Customization Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--owner <name>` | Filter to a specific owner | All owners |
| `--project <name>` | Filter to a specific project | All projects |
| `--width <px>` | Canvas width | `1200` |
| `--height <px>` | Canvas height | `800` |
| `--include-done` | Include completed tasks | `false` |

## Text Dashboard

For terminal-based workflows, `clawvault dashboard` prints a vault summary:

```bash
clawvault dashboard
```

Output:

```
 ClawVault Dashboard — ~/memory
─────────────────────────────────
Tasks:     12 total (4 todo, 5 in-progress, 1 review, 2 blocked)
Backlog:   8 items
Memories:  234 files across 14 categories
Last wake: 2026-02-14 09:15 EST
Blocked:   2 tasks (1 escalated ⚠️)
─────────────────────────────────
Recent activity:
  • task-a1b2c3 → in-progress (clawdious, 2h ago)
  • task-d4e5f6 → blocked (agent-2, 4h ago)
  • Stored 3 new memories today
```

## Stats

Get detailed metrics about your vault:

```bash
clawvault stats
```

Shows memory counts by category, task velocity, transition patterns, and storage usage.

## Obsidian Bases as Dashboards

The `.base` files generated by ClawVault act as lightweight dashboards inside Obsidian:

- `all-tasks.base` — sortable/filterable task table
- `blocked.base` — blocked tasks with escalation flags
- `by-project.base` — tasks grouped by project
- `by-owner.base` — tasks grouped by owner
- `backlog.base` — backlog items

These update automatically as you modify task files — no regeneration needed.

<Callout type="info">
Bases views are the easiest way to get a dashboard without leaving Obsidian. For richer visuals, use `clawvault canvas`.
</Callout>

## Neural Graph Theme

ClawVault includes a **neural** theme that styles your Obsidian vault with a graph-inspired aesthetic — dark backgrounds, glowing node connections, and color-coded categories.

Apply during init or setup:

```bash
# During initialization
clawvault init ~/memory --theme neural

# On an existing vault
clawvault setup --theme neural
```

The theme adds CSS snippets and graph view settings to your vault's `.obsidian/` directory.
