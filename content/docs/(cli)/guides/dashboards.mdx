# Dashboards and Views

ClawVault provides text-based summaries, stats, and Obsidian Bases views for vault management.

## Text Dashboard

For terminal-based workflows, `clawvault dashboard` prints a vault summary:

```bash
clawvault dashboard
```

Output:

```
ClawVault Dashboard — ~/memory
-----------------------------------------
Tasks:     12 total (4 todo, 5 in-progress, 1 review, 2 blocked)
Backlog:   8 items
Memories:  234 files across 14 categories
Last wake: 2026-02-14 09:15 EST
Blocked:   2 tasks (1 escalated)
-----------------------------------------
Recent activity:
  - task-a1b2c3 -> in-progress (clawdious, 2h ago)
  - task-d4e5f6 -> blocked (agent-2, 4h ago)
  - Stored 3 new memories today
```

## Stats

Get detailed metrics about your vault:

```bash
clawvault stats
```

Shows memory counts by category, task velocity, transition patterns, and storage usage.

## Obsidian Bases as Dashboards

The `.base` files generated by ClawVault act as lightweight dashboards inside Obsidian:

- `all-tasks.base` — sortable/filterable task table
- `blocked.base` — blocked tasks with escalation flags
- `by-project.base` — tasks grouped by project
- `by-owner.base` — tasks grouped by owner
- `backlog.base` — backlog items

These update automatically as you modify task files — no regeneration needed.

Bases views are the recommended way to get a dashboard experience without leaving Obsidian. Run `clawvault setup --bases` to generate them.
</Callout>

## Kanban Board

The `Board.md` file is a Kanban-format board compatible with the Obsidian Kanban plugin:

```bash
clawvault kanban sync
```

This generates columns for each task status (open, in-progress, blocked, done) with cards linking to task files.

## Neural Graph Theme

ClawVault includes a **neural** theme that styles your Obsidian vault with a graph-inspired aesthetic — dark backgrounds, glowing node connections, and color-coded categories.

Apply during init or setup:

```bash
# During initialization
clawvault init ~/memory --theme neural

# On an existing vault
clawvault setup --theme neural
```

The theme adds CSS snippets and graph view settings to your vault's `.obsidian/` directory.
