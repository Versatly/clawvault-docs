# Obsidian Integration

A ClawVault vault is a directory of Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. This makes it natively compatible with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) -- you can open it as an Obsidian vault and get graph view, backlinks, tags, and visual editing for free.

## Opening the Vault in Obsidian

<Steps>
<Step>
### Open as vault

In Obsidian, select "Open folder as vault" and point it to your ClawVault directory (the folder containing `.clawvault.json`).
</Step>
<Step>
### Exclude internal files

Create or edit `.obsidian/app.json` to exclude ClawVault internal files from search and graph:

```json
{
  "userIgnoreFilters": [
    ".clawvault.json",
    ".clawvault/",
    "*.qmd"
  ]
}
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Enable wiki-links

Obsidian uses wiki-links by default (`[[link]]`), which matches ClawVault's linking format. Ensure "Use Wikilinks" is enabled in Settings > Files and Links.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Wiki-Links and Graph View

ClawVault's `link` command generates wiki-links in the same `[[entity]]` format Obsidian uses. This means:

- **Backlinks panel** shows all files that reference an entity
- **Graph view** visualizes the full knowledge graph
- **Clicking a link** navigates to the referenced file

Run `clawvault link --all` to ensure all entity mentions are linked before opening in Obsidian.

```bash
clawvault link --all
# Links resolved: 47 mentions across 23 files
```

The graph view in Obsidian will mirror what `clawvault graph` shows, with the added benefit of interactive exploration.

<Callout type="info">
ClawVault wiki-links use the entity slug as the link target (e.g., `[[pedro]]` links to `people/pedro.md`). Obsidian resolves these automatically as long as file names match.
</Callout>

## Tags and Frontmatter

ClawVault stores metadata in YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: dec-20260210-auth-refactor
title: "Auth Refactor Decision"
type: decision
category: decisions
tags: [architecture, auth, backend]
related: ["[[project-api]]", "[[pedro]]"]
created: 2026-02-10T14:30:00Z
---
```

Obsidian reads this frontmatter natively:

- **Tags** appear in the tag pane and are searchable
- **Properties** (Obsidian 1.4+) display frontmatter fields in a structured view
- **Dataview** plugin can query across all memories using frontmatter fields

Example Dataview query for all decisions:

```
```dataview
TABLE title, created
FROM "decisions"
SORT created DESC
```
```

## Daily Notes

ClawVault's daily memory files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) align with Obsidian's daily notes pattern. Configure Obsidian's Daily Notes plugin:

- **Date format:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **New file location:** your vault's memory folder
- **Template:** optional, but ClawVault daily files already have frontmatter

This lets you view your agent's daily activity logs using Obsidian's calendar and daily notes navigation.

## Cross-Platform Sync

Since the vault is plain Markdown files, any file sync tool works:

### Git (Recommended)

See [Version Control](/guides/git-workflows) for detailed Git workflows.

```bash
# End session with a handoff, then commit vault changes
clawvault sleep "session done"
git add -A && git commit -m "vault: session done" && git push

# Pull from another machine
cd vault && git pull
```

### Obsidian Sync

If you use Obsidian Sync, the vault syncs automatically across devices. Be aware that:

- `.clawvault.json` and index files should be excluded from sync (they are machine-specific)
- The search index (`qmd`) is not portable; each machine needs its own

### File Sync (Syncthing, Dropbox)

Works for the Markdown files. Exclude:

- `.clawvault/` (internal state)
- `*.qmd` (search index, machine-specific)

<Callout type="warn">
If you edit files in Obsidian while the agent is running, run `clawvault reindex` afterward to update the search index. ClawVault does not watch for external file changes.
</Callout>
