The `checkpoint` command records your current working state so recovery has recent context if a session crashes or resets unexpectedly.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault checkpoint [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--working-on <text>` | What you are currently working on | — |
| `--focus <text>` | Current focus area | — |
| `--blocked <text>` | What is blocking progress | — |
| `--urgent` | Trigger OpenClaw wake after checkpoint | false |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--json` | Output as JSON | false |

## Examples

```bash
# Quick checkpoint
clawvault checkpoint --working-on "auth refactor" --focus "token validation"

# Checkpoint with blocker info
clawvault checkpoint \
  --working-on "API integration" \
  --focus "rate limiting" \
  --blocked "waiting for vendor docs"

# Trigger urgent wake notification
clawvault checkpoint --working-on "prod outage triage" --urgent
```

## Details

Checkpoints are written to `.clawvault/last-checkpoint.json` and update the context-death dirty flag. During heavy work, frequent checkpoints reduce restart cost after interruptions.
