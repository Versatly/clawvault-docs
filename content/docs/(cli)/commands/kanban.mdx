<span className="cv-version">v2.4.6</span>

The `kanban` command generates [Obsidian Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) boards from your vault's tasks, and can reverse-sync changes made on the board back into task frontmatter.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault kanban sync [options]
clawvault kanban import [options]
```

### `kanban sync` options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--output <path>` | Board markdown path | `Board.md` |
| `--group-by <field>` | Grouping field: `status`, `priority`, `project`, `owner` | `status` |
| `--filter-project <project>` | Only include tasks from a project | all |
| `--filter-owner <owner>` | Only include tasks for an owner | all |
| `--include-done` | Include completed tasks | false |

### `kanban import` options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--output <path>` | Board markdown path | `Board.md` |

## Examples

```bash
# Generate a Kanban board grouped by status
clawvault kanban sync

# Group by priority instead
clawvault kanban sync --group-by priority

# Only show tasks for a specific project
clawvault kanban sync --filter-project clawvault

# Include done tasks
clawvault kanban sync --include-done

# Write to a custom path
clawvault kanban sync --output boards/sprint.md

# Reverse-sync: import board changes back into task frontmatter
clawvault kanban import

# Import from a custom board path
clawvault kanban import --output boards/sprint.md
```

## Sync: Tasks → Board

`kanban sync` reads all tasks from `tasks/` and generates an Obsidian Kanban-compatible markdown file. Cards include:

- Wiki-linked task title (`[[slug|Title]]`)
- Priority emoji (🔥 critical, 🔴 high, 🟡 medium, 🟢 low)
- Project as hashtag (`#project-name`)
- Owner as mention (`@owner`)
- Tags as hashtags
- Due date with 📅 icon
- ⛔ indicator for blocked tasks

Tasks within each lane are sorted by due date (earliest first), then by creation date.

### Grouping

The `--group-by` flag controls how lanes are organized:

| Group By | Lanes |
|----------|-------|
| `status` | Open, In Progress, Blocked, Done |
| `priority` | 🔥 Critical, 🔴 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Low, ⚪ Unset |
| `project` | One lane per project + "No Project" |
| `owner` | One lane per owner + "Unassigned" |

## Import: Board → Tasks

`kanban import` reads the generated board file and updates task frontmatter to match the board's lane assignments. The `clawvault-group-by` frontmatter key in the board file determines which field gets updated.

For example, if a board is grouped by `status` and you drag a card from "Open" to "In Progress" in Obsidian, running `kanban import` will update that task's `status` field to `in-progress`.

```bash
$ clawvault kanban import
✓ Imported kanban board: /path/to/vault/Board.md
  Grouped by: status
  Updated 2 task field(s):
  - write-api-docs: status open -> in-progress
  - fix-auth-bug: status in-progress -> done
```

Tasks referenced on the board that no longer exist in `tasks/` are reported as missing.

## Details

The board file includes Obsidian Kanban plugin metadata in YAML frontmatter (`kanban-plugin: basic`) and a settings block at the end. ClawVault adds `clawvault-group-by` and `clawvault-last-sync` fields to track sync state. The Done lane is collapsed by default.
