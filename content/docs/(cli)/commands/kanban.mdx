The `kanban` command keeps task frontmatter and an Obsidian Kanban board in sync.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault kanban sync [options]
clawvault kanban import
```

## `kanban sync`

Generates a Kanban board markdown file from current task state.

```bash
clawvault kanban sync [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--output <path>` | Output board file path | `Board.md` |
| `--group-by <mode>` | Lane grouping (`status`, `priority`, `project`, `owner`) | `status` |
| `--filter-project <project>` | Include only tasks from one project | all |
| `--filter-owner <owner>` | Include only tasks for one owner | all |
| `--include-done` | Include completed tasks/lane content | false |

### Examples

```bash
# Default status board
clawvault kanban sync

# Group by owner into a custom board path
clawvault kanban sync --group-by owner --output "boards/Team Board.md"

# Project-specific board
clawvault kanban sync --filter-project api
```

## `kanban import`

Reads an existing Kanban board markdown file and applies lane-driven updates back to task files.

```bash
clawvault kanban import
```

During import, ClawVault detects lane changes and updates task frontmatter fields such as `status`, `priority`, `project`, and `owner`.

## Output Format

`kanban sync` emits markdown compatible with **Obsidian Kanban plugin v2**.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Generate or refresh a board with `clawvault kanban sync`.
2. Edit and drag cards in `Board.md` inside Obsidian Kanban.
3. Run `clawvault kanban import` to write those board changes back into task frontmatter files.
