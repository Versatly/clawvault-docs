The `init` and `setup` commands handle vault creation and configuration. Use `init` to create a new vault from scratch, or `setup` to auto-discover and configure an existing memory folder.

## clawvault init

**Create a new ClawVault in the specified directory.**

```bash
clawvault init [path] [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-n, --name <name>` | Vault name | Directory name |
| `--qmd` | Set up qmd semantic search collection | false |
| `--qmd-collection <name>` | qmd collection name | Vault name |

### Examples

```bash
# Initialize in current directory
clawvault init

# Initialize with a name and semantic search
clawvault init ~/my-vault --name "work-memory" --qmd

# Initialize with custom qmd collection
clawvault init ./memory --qmd --qmd-collection my-agent
```

This creates the `.clawvault/` configuration directory with vault metadata, category folders, and search indexes.

## clawvault setup

**Auto-discover and configure a ClawVault from an existing memory folder.**

```bash
clawvault setup
```

<Callout type="info">
  `setup` has no options — it automatically finds the nearest OpenClaw memory folder and configures it as a ClawVault. This is the fastest way to get started if you already have an OpenClaw workspace.
</Callout>

### What Setup Does

1. Discovers the OpenClaw memory folder (via `OPENCLAW_HOME` or standard paths)
2. Creates `.clawvault/` configuration if missing
3. Builds the search index
4. Validates vault structure

### Example

```bash
# From your OpenClaw workspace
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory
clawvault setup
```

## When to Use Which

- **`init`** — Starting fresh, or creating a vault outside of OpenClaw
- **`setup`** — Already have a memory folder from OpenClaw and want to add ClawVault on top
