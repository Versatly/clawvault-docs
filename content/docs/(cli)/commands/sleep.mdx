title: "sleep"
description: "End a session with structured handoff, optional git commit, and observation processing"
---

The `sleep` command closes a work session with a durable handoff so the next session can resume quickly and safely.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault sleep <summary> [options]
```

### Required

- `<summary>` — What you were working on (comma-separated for multiple items)

### Options

| Flag | Description | Interactive Prompt |
|------|-------------|--------------------|
| `--next <items>` | Next steps to take | "Next steps (comma-separated):" |
| `--blocked <items>` | Current blockers | "Blocked items (comma-separated):" |
| `--decisions <items>` | Key decisions made | No prompt |
| `--questions <items>` | Open questions | No prompt |
| `--feeling <text>` | How the session felt | No prompt |
| `--session <key>` | Session key override | No prompt |
| `--session-transcript <path>` | Transcript path for auto-observe | Auto-detected |
| `--reflect` | Run reflection pass after handoff | No prompt |
| `--index` | Update qmd index after handoff | false |
| `--no-git` | Skip git commit prompt | N/A |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |

## Examples

```bash
# End session with summary only (interactive prompts for next/blocked)
clawvault sleep "auth refactor and token validation"

# Fully specified handoff
clawvault sleep "built onboarding API" \
  --next "write integration tests,deploy staging" \
  --blocked "waiting for vendor docs" \
  --decisions "use Redis cache" \
  --feeling "focused"

# Include transcript ingestion and reflection
clawvault sleep "closed incident follow-up" --session-transcript ./session.jsonl --reflect
```

## Details

When next/blocked values are missing and the shell is interactive, `sleep` prompts for them. It then writes a handoff document, clears context-death flags, optionally updates qmd index, optionally commits dirty git state, and best-effort processes observations from the session transcript.
