The `blocked` command gives a focused view of tasks with `status: blocked`, including blocker reasons and project context.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault blocked [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--project <project>` | Filter blocked tasks by project | all projects |
| `--escalated` | Show only escalated tasks (3+ blocked transitions) | false |
| `--json` | Output as JSON | false |

## Examples

```bash
# Show all blocked work
clawvault blocked

# Show blocked tasks in one project
clawvault blocked --project growth

# JSON output for automation
clawvault blocked --json
```

## Details

This command is equivalent to listing tasks filtered by `status=blocked`, but with output optimized for triage: title, blocker (`blocked_by`), owner, project, and updated time.
