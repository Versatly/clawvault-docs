description: "Capture ideas in backlog and promote them into tasks"
---

The `backlog` command manages idea-level work in `backlog/`, then promotes ready items into `tasks/`.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault backlog add <title> [options]
clawvault backlog list [options]
clawvault backlog promote <slug> [options]
```

### `backlog add` options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--source <source>` | Source of the idea | none |
| `--project <project>` | Project name | none |

### `backlog list` options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--project <project>` | Filter by project | all |
| `--json` | Output as JSON | false |

### `backlog promote` options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--owner <owner>` | Owner for the promoted task | none |
| `--priority <priority>` | Priority for the promoted task | low |
| `--due <date>` | Due date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for the promoted task | none |

## Examples

```bash
# Capture a backlog item
clawvault backlog add "Explore SOC2 automation" --project platform --source customer-call

# Review backlog for one project
clawvault backlog list --project platform

# Promote an item into tasks/
clawvault backlog promote explore-soc2-automation --priority high --owner dana
```

## Details

Backlog items are stored as markdown files in `backlog/` with frontmatter like `source`, `project`, `created`, and `tags`. Promoting an item creates a task in `tasks/` and removes the original backlog file.
