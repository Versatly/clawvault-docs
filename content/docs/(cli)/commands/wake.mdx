description: "Start a session with context recovery, recap, and observation highlights"

The `wake` command is ClawVault's session bootstrap. It checks for context death, restores checkpoint context, and builds a recap for fast restart.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault wake [options]
```

### What Wake Does

1. Checks for context death and clears the dirty flag
2. Generates a recap from recent handoffs
3. Includes recent observations (structural and potential importance)
4. Generates an executive summary when an LLM is available

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--handoff-limit <n>` | Max recent handoffs to include | 3 |
| `--brief` | Compact output for token efficiency | true |
| `--no-summary` | Skip LLM executive summary generation | false |

## Examples

```bash
# Standard wake flow
clawvault wake

# Include more handoffs
clawvault wake --handoff-limit 5

# Skip executive summary generation
clawvault wake --no-summary
```

## Details

`wake` is typically the first command in each session. It pairs with `sleep` for continuity and with `checkpoint` for high-frequency recovery during intensive work.
