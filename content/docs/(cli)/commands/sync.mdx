import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

The `sync` command copies vault files to a target directory, useful for mirroring your vault to another location (e.g., an Obsidian vault, a backup folder, or a shared drive).

## Usage

```bash
clawvault sync <target> [options]
```

### Required

- `<target>` — Destination path to sync files to

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--delete` | Delete orphan files in target | false |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be synced without syncing | false |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |

## Examples

```bash
# Sync to an Obsidian vault
clawvault sync ~/obsidian-vault/clawvault/

# Preview what would be synced
clawvault sync ~/backup --dry-run

# Mirror exactly (delete files in target that aren't in source)
clawvault sync ~/mirror --delete
```

<Callout type="warn">
  The `--delete` flag removes files in the target that do not exist in the source vault. Use `--dry-run` first to verify.
</Callout>
