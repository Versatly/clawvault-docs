import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

The `archive` command moves observation files older than a specified threshold into the `ledger/archive/` directory. This keeps the active observation set lean while preserving historical data.

_Added in v2.2.0_

## Usage

```bash
clawvault archive [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--older-than <days>` | Archive observations older than this many days | 14 |
| `--dry-run` | Show archive candidates without moving files | false |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |

## How It Works

Observation files with dates older than the specified threshold are moved from the active observation directory into `ledger/archive/`. Archived observations are excluded from normal searches and context assembly but remain available for historical analysis.

<Callout type="info">
  The `reflect` command can trigger an automatic archive pass after generating reflections. Use the standalone `archive` command when you want explicit control over retention.
</Callout>

## Examples

```bash
# Archive observations older than 14 days (default)
clawvault archive

# Archive observations older than 30 days
clawvault archive --older-than 30

# Preview what would be archived
clawvault archive --dry-run
```
