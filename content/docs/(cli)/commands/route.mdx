description: "Manage custom entity routing rules used by the observer"
---

The `route` command lets you manage custom routing rules for observer output.

Custom routes are evaluated **before** built-in category/entity routing patterns, so explicit rules can override default behavior when needed.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault route add <pattern> <target>
clawvault route remove <pattern>
clawvault route list
clawvault route test <text>
```

## Commands

### `route add <pattern> <target>`

Adds a custom route rule.

```bash
clawvault route add "acme corp" "projects/acme.md"
clawvault route add "pedro santos" "people/pedro.md"
```

### `route remove <pattern>`

Removes a custom route rule by pattern.

```bash
clawvault route remove "acme corp"
```

### `route list`

Lists all custom routes currently configured.

```bash
clawvault route list
```

### `route test <text>`

Tests sample text against current routing rules.

```bash
clawvault route test "Follow up with Pedro Santos on Acme launch readiness."
```

## Storage

Route rules are stored in `.clawvault.json` under the `routes` array. Because routes are configuration-backed, they can be tracked in git and shared across environments.
