The `entities` command lists all entities that can be referenced via wiki-links in your vault — people, projects, decisions, and other named items.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault entities [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--json` | Output as JSON | false |

## Examples

```bash
# List all entities
clawvault entities

# JSON output for scripting
clawvault entities --json
```

Entities are derived from vault file paths and frontmatter. They form the nodes in ClawVault's knowledge graph and can be referenced with `[[wiki-links]]` in any vault document.
