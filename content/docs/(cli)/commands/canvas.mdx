---

The `canvas` command generates visual dashboards as Obsidian JSON Canvas files. Choose from built-in templates or filter by project, owner, or scope.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault canvas [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--output <path>` | Output canvas file path | `<vault>/dashboard.canvas` |
| `--template <id>` | Template: `default`, `brain`, `project-board`, `sprint` | `default` |
| `--project <name>` | Filter tasks/backlog by project | All projects |
| `--owner <name>` | Filter tasks by owner (agent or human) | All owners |
| `--width <px>` | Canvas width in pixels | Template default |
| `--height <px>` | Canvas height in pixels | Template default |
| `--include-done` | Include completed tasks | Limited |
| `--list-templates` | List available templates and exit | — |

## Templates

### `default` — Two-Column Dashboard

The original layout with knowledge graph stats on the left and task triage on the right. Includes data flow diagram, vault activity metrics, and observation summaries.

### `brain` — Brain Architecture

A 4-quadrant system overview inspired by neuroscience-themed knowledge management:

- **Hippocampus** (top-left): vault structure with category card grid, content flow pipeline
- **Direction** (top-right): vault stats, recent decisions, open loops
- **Agent Workspace** (bottom-left): 3-column task triage — active, blocked, backlog
- **Knowledge Graph** (bottom-right): node/edge stats, most-connected entities, category bars

### `project-board` — Owner-Centric Task Board

Kanban-style board focused on task management for agents and humans:

- Status columns: Open / In Progress / Blocked / Done
- Priority icons: 🔴 critical, 🟠 high, 🟡 medium
- Owner cards distinguishing agents (🤖) from humans (👤)
- Backlog grouped by project
- Blocked-by edges connecting dependent tasks

### `sprint` — Sprint Focus

Weekly focus board with sprint metrics, recent decisions, and open loops.

## Examples

```bash
# Default dashboard
clawvault canvas

# Brain architecture overview
clawvault canvas --template brain --output brain-dashboard.canvas

# Project board filtered by owner
clawvault canvas --template project-board --owner clawdious

# Project-scoped board
clawvault canvas --template project-board --project hale-pet-door

# List all available templates
clawvault canvas --list-templates
```

## Details

Canvas files follow the [JSON Canvas specification](https://jsoncanvas.org) and open directly in Obsidian. File nodes are clickable — task cards link to their markdown files.

The `brain` template reads from the memory graph index (run `clawvault graph build` first for best results). The `project-board` template reads from `tasks/` and `backlog/` directories.
