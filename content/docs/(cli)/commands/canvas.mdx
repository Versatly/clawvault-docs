---

The `canvas` command builds a `dashboard.canvas` file that visualizes vault activity, knowledge graph signals, and execution flow in Obsidian.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault canvas [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--output <path>` | Output canvas file path | `<vault>/dashboard.canvas` |

## Examples

```bash
# Generate dashboard.canvas in the vault root
clawvault canvas

# Write to a custom canvas path
clawvault canvas --output views/weekly-dashboard.canvas

# Build canvas for a different vault
clawvault canvas -v ~/work-vault
```

## Details

Generated canvas groups include:

- Knowledge graph stats and top entities
- Active tasks, blocked tasks, backlog, and recently done work
- Recent decisions and observation summaries
- Vault activity stats (documents, sessions, ledger, reflections)
- Observation pipeline flow diagram

The file follows the Obsidian JSON Canvas specification and can be opened directly inside Obsidian.
