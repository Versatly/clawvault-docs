description: "Generate an Obsidian JSON Canvas dashboard from vault state"
---

The `canvas` command generates a visual dashboard as an Obsidian JSON Canvas file from your vault's current state — tasks, projects, graph stats, and observations.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault canvas [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--output <path>` | Output canvas file path | `dashboard.canvas` |

## Examples

```bash
# Generate default dashboard
clawvault canvas

# Custom output path
clawvault canvas --output my-dashboard.canvas

# Specific vault
clawvault canvas -v ~/my-vault
```

## Details

Canvas files follow the [JSON Canvas specification](https://jsoncanvas.org) and open directly in Obsidian. File nodes are clickable — task cards link to their markdown files.

The generated dashboard includes vault statistics, task triage columns, and knowledge graph metrics drawn from your vault's current state.
