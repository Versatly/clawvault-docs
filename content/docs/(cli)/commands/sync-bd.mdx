The `sync-bd` command pulls active tasks from the [beads](https://github.com/impredicative/bd) (`bd`) task manager and writes them into `views/now.md`. This gives your AI agent awareness of external tasks tracked in beads.

_Added in v2.2.0_

## Usage

```bash
clawvault sync-bd [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be synced without writing | false |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |

## Requirements

The `bd` binary must be installed and on your `PATH`. If it is not found, the command exits silently with no error.

<Callout type="info">
  This command is optional and only relevant if you use beads for task management. See the [Beads integration guide](/integrations/beads) for setup details.
</Callout>

## How It Works

1. Checks for the `bd` binary on your system
2. Queries active tasks via `bd list --json` (falls back to plain text output)
3. Filters out tasks with status `done`, `completed`, or `closed`
4. Upserts an "Active Tasks (from bd)" section in `views/now.md`

## Examples

```bash
# Sync bd tasks into views/now.md
clawvault sync-bd

# Preview the sync
clawvault sync-bd --dry-run
```
