The `setup` command finds or creates a vault path and initializes the ClawVault structure automatically.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault setup
```

## Options

`setup` has no command-line flags. It resolves the target path from:

1. `CLAWVAULT_PATH` (if set)
2. `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory`
3. `./memory`
4. `~/memory`

## Examples

```bash
# Auto-discover nearest/default memory path
clawvault setup

# Force a specific path via environment variable
CLAWVAULT_PATH=~/work/memory clawvault setup
```

## Details

`setup` ensures category folders and `.clawvault.json` exist, then attempts qmd collection setup when qmd is installed. For manual vault creation at a specific path, use `clawvault init [path]`.
