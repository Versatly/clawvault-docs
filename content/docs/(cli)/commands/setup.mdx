title: "setup"
description: "Auto-discover and configure a ClawVault with graph colors, Bases views, and canvas dashboards"
---

The `setup` command finds or creates a vault path, initializes the structure, and optionally configures Obsidian graph colors, Bases task views, and canvas dashboards.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault setup [options]
```

## Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Target vault path | Auto-discovered |
| `--theme <style>` | Graph color theme: `neural`, `minimal`, `none` | `neural` |
| `--graph-colors` | Set up graph color scheme for Obsidian | Included by default |
| `--no-graph-colors` | Skip graph color configuration | — |
| `--bases` | Generate Obsidian Bases views for task management | Included by default |
| `--no-bases` | Skip Bases file generation | — |
| `--canvas [template]` | Generate a canvas dashboard (`default`, `brain`, `project-board`, `sprint`) | Not generated |
| `--no-canvas` | Skip canvas generation | — |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing configuration files | Skip existing |

## Vault Discovery

When no `--vault` flag is provided, `setup` resolves the target from:

1. `CLAWVAULT_PATH` environment variable (if set)
2. `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory` (OpenClaw default)
3. `./memory` (current directory)
4. `~/memory` (home directory)

## Graph Themes

### `neural` (default)

Dark background (#0a0a0a), colored nodes by category and tag:
- People: cyan · Projects: green · Decisions: orange · Lessons: yellow
- Commitments: red · Tasks: teal · Observations: purple
- Green neural-network links, golden glow on focused nodes

Writes a CSS snippet to `.obsidian/snippets/clawvault-graph.css`, enables it in `appearance.json`, and configures `graph.json` colorGroups by folder path.

### `minimal`

Subtle category colors without dark background. Lighter touch for vaults with existing themes.

### `none`

Skips all graph color configuration.

## Obsidian Bases Views

When Bases are generated, these files are created in the vault root:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `all-tasks.base` | Table + card views grouped by status |
| `blocked.base` | Blocked tasks with days-blocked formula |
| `by-project.base` | Tasks grouped by project |
| `by-owner.base` | Tasks grouped by owner (agent or human) |
| `backlog.base` | Backlog items by source and project |

## Examples

```bash
# Full setup with neural theme (default)
clawvault setup

# Setup with brain architecture canvas
clawvault setup --canvas brain

# Minimal setup — structure only, no visual config
clawvault setup --no-graph-colors --no-bases

# Force-overwrite existing configs
clawvault setup --force --theme neural

# Target a specific vault
clawvault setup -v ~/projects/agent-memory
```
