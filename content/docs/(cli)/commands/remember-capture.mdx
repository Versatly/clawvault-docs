The `remember` and `capture` commands are the primary ways to store information in ClawVault. Use `remember` for structured memories with specific types, and `capture` for quick notes that you'll process later.

## clawvault remember

**Store typed memories with classification.**

```bash
clawvault remember <type> <title> --content <content> [options]
```

### Memory Types

| Type | Description | Example Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `fact` | Static information | API endpoints, configurations |
| `feeling` | Emotional context | Meeting sentiment, confidence levels | 
| `decision` | Choices with reasoning | Architecture choices, tool selections |
| `lesson` | Learning from experience | What worked/failed, insights |
| `commitment` | Promises and deadlines | Project deliverables, meeting promises |
| `preference` | Subjective choices | Code styles, work patterns |
| `relationship` | People and interactions | Team members, client contacts |
| `project` | Active work | Current initiatives, goals |

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Technical decision
clawvault remember decision "Use PostgreSQL over SQLite" \
 --content "Need concurrent writes for multi-agent setup. SQLite locks cause bottlenecks under load."

# Learning from experience 
clawvault remember lesson "Always backup before schema changes" \
 --content "Lost 2 hours of data during migration testing. Automated backups now required."

# Person and working relationship
clawvault remember relationship "Sarah Chen - Product Manager" \
 --content "Detail-oriented, prefers data-driven decisions. Responds best to Slack, not email. Timezone: PST."

# Project status
clawvault remember project "User Dashboard Redesign" \
 --content "Q1 initiative. Focus on mobile-first, reduce clicks by 30%. A/B testing framework ready."
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--content <content>` | Content body | — |
| `-f, --file <file>` | Read content from file | — |
| `--stdin` | Read content from stdin | false |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--no-index` | Skip qmd index update | false |

### Advanced Examples

#### With Tags and Templates
```bash
clawvault remember decision "API Rate Limiting Strategy" \
 --content "Implement token bucket with Redis backend" \
 --tags "api,performance,redis" \
 --template decision
```

#### Custom Categories
```bash
clawvault remember fact "Production Database Config" \
 --content "Host: prod-db.company.com, Port: 5432" \
 --category infrastructure
```

#### Wiki-Links in Content
```bash
clawvault remember decision "Choose React over Vue" \
 --content "[[sarah-chen]] and [[tech-team]] discussed. React has better TypeScript support for our [[user-dashboard]] project."
```

## clawvault capture

**Quick capture for unstructured notes.**

```bash
clawvault capture <text> [options]
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Quick TODO
clawvault capture "TODO: Review PR #156 tomorrow"

# Meeting note
clawvault capture "Client wants dark mode toggle by Friday demo"

# Idea or insight
clawvault capture "Could use Redis for session cache instead of database"

# Bug report
clawvault capture "Auth flow breaks when user has no email - investigate TokenError"
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-t, --title <title>` | Note title | Auto-generated from content |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--no-index` | Skip qmd index update | false |

### Auto-Title Generation

Capture automatically generates titles from content:

```bash
clawvault capture "TODO: Review PR #156 tomorrow"
# → Title: "Review PR #156 tomorrow" (strips TODO prefix)

clawvault capture "Client wants dark mode toggle by Friday demo" 
# → Title: "Client wants dark mode toggle by Friday demo" (first 50 chars)
```

### Custom Titles
```bash
clawvault capture "Long detailed note about the meeting..." \
 --title "Client Meeting Notes"
```

## Processing Captured Notes

Captured items go to `inbox/` by default for later processing:

```bash
# View inbox items
clawvault list inbox

# Process into structured memories
clawvault get inbox/client-dark-mode-request
# → Review content, then:
clawvault remember commitment "Dark mode toggle for client demo" \
 --content "Client requested by Friday. Impacts: dashboard, settings panel, email templates."
```

## Memory Type Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Type

**fact** - Information that doesn't change:
```bash
clawvault remember fact "Stripe API Rate Limit" \
 --content "100 requests per second per API key"
```

**decision** - Choices with lasting impact:
```bash
clawvault remember decision "Move from REST to GraphQL" \
 --content "Better for mobile app performance. Single endpoint, flexible queries."
```

**lesson** - Insights from experience:
```bash
clawvault remember lesson "Microservices require careful boundaries" \
 --content "Split too early, spent 3 weeks merging services. Start monolithic, extract later."
```

**commitment** - Time-bound promises:
```bash
clawvault remember commitment "Demo ready by Friday 3pm" \
 --content "Promised working user auth + basic dashboard to client"
```

**preference** - Subjective choices:
```bash
clawvault remember preference "Async standups work better" \
 --content "Team prefers written updates. More thoughtful, less interruption."
```

**relationship** - People and interactions:
```bash
clawvault remember relationship "Alex Kim - Frontend Dev" \
 --content "CSS expert, prefers styled-components. Available 10am-6pm EST."
```

**project** - Active initiatives:
```bash
clawvault remember project "Payment Integration v2" \
 --content "Replace Stripe Checkout with custom flow. Better UX, lower fees."
```

**feeling** - Emotional context:
```bash
clawvault remember feeling "Team Meeting Went Well" \
 --content "Good energy, productive discussion. Everyone aligned on priorities."
```

## Integration with Observational Memory

Structured memories enhance observational memory classification:

```bash
# Session transcript mentions: "We decided to use Redis for caching"
# Observer auto-routes to decisions/ because "decided" keyword detected

# But explicit decision memory provides richer context:
clawvault remember decision "Use Redis for Application Cache" \
 --content "Performance tests show 3x faster response times. Simpler than Memcached setup."
```

## Bulk Operations

### Multiple Captures
```bash
# Process multiple quick notes
clawvault capture "Fix user avatar upload bug"
clawvault capture "Research competitor pricing" 
clawvault capture "Schedule team retro meeting"
```

### From File Content
```bash
# Store file content as memory
clawvault remember fact "API Documentation" \
 --content "$(cat api-spec.md)" \
 --tags "api,docs"
```

## Best Practices

### Use Capture for Speed
```bash
# During meetings/conversations - capture first
clawvault capture "Sarah suggested using Docker for local dev"
clawvault capture "Client budget increased to 50k"
clawvault capture "Bug: payment flow fails on Safari"

# Later - process into structured memories 
clawvault remember preference "Docker for Local Development" \
 --content "[[sarah-chen]] suggested. Standardizes environment across team."
```

### Include Context in Decisions
```bash
# Good - includes reasoning
clawvault remember decision "Use TypeScript for new microservice" \
 --content "Team comfortable with TS. Better error catching. Easier refactoring than JS."

# Less useful - just the choice
clawvault remember decision "Use TypeScript" --content "Decided to use TypeScript"
```

### Link Related Memories
```bash
clawvault remember project "Mobile App v2" \
 --content "Related to [[api-redesign-decision]] and [[react-native-preference]]. Targets Q2 launch."
```

### Tag for Discovery
```bash
clawvault remember lesson "Database Connection Pooling" \
 --content "PgBouncer reduced connection overhead by 60%" \
 --tags "database,performance,postgresql,optimization"
```

## Error Handling

```bash
# Missing required content
clawvault remember decision "Use GraphQL"
# Error: --content is required

# Invalid memory type
clawvault remember invalid-type "Title" --content "Content" 
# Error: Unknown memory type. Valid types: fact, feeling, decision, lesson, commitment, preference, relationship, project

# Empty capture
clawvault capture ""
# Error: Capture text cannot be empty
```

<Callout type="info">
Start with `capture` during active work for speed, then use `remember` during reflection time to create structured, searchable memories.
</Callout>

The remember/capture pattern balances speed (capture everything) with structure (remember meaningfully) to ensure nothing important gets lost.
