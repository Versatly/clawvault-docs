ClawVault networking commands let you expose a vault API on your tailnet, manage trusted peers, and run cross-vault search.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault serve [options]
clawvault peers [list]
clawvault peers add <ip> --trust <level>
clawvault net-search <query>
```

## `clawvault serve`

Expose your vault over Tailscale.

```bash
clawvault serve [--port 7283] [--funnel] [--background] [--stop]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--port <number>` | Port to serve on | 7283 |
| `--funnel` | Enable Tailscale Funnel (public exposure) | false |
| `--background` | Run in background mode | false |
| `--stop` | Stop an active serve process | false |

## `clawvault peers`

Manage trusted vault peers.

```bash
clawvault peers
clawvault peers list
clawvault peers add <ip> --trust read|read-write|full
```

### Trust levels

| Level | Access |
|-------|--------|
| `read` | Read and search only |
| `read-write` | Read plus write observations |
| `full` | Full vault access |

## `clawvault net-search`

Search connected vault peers over Tailscale.

```bash
clawvault net-search <query>
```

## Examples

```bash
# Start serving this vault on tailnet
clawvault serve

# Add a trusted peer
clawvault peers add 100.70.233.52 --trust read

# Query memories across peers
clawvault net-search "database migration decision"
```

## Details

`serve` exposes your local vault API to your Tailscale network, `peers` controls trust and peer registry, and `net-search` runs federated search across connected vaults without requiring public cloud sync.
