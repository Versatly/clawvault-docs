Use `clean-exit` when you want to explicitly mark the current session as a clean shutdown.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault clean-exit [options]
```

## Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |

## Examples

```bash
# Mark current vault as cleanly exited
clawvault clean-exit

# Target a specific vault
clawvault clean-exit -v ~/memory
```

## Details

ClawVault uses a dirty-death marker to detect context death on startup. `clean-exit` clears that marker when a session exits intentionally, so the next `wake`/`recover` run does not report a false crash signal.
