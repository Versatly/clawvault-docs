---

The `dashboard` command starts a local web server that provides a visual graph view of your vault — nodes, edges, entity relationships, and type statistics.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault dashboard [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-p, --port <port>` | Dashboard port | 3377 |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |

## Examples

```bash
# Start the dashboard
clawvault dashboard

# Custom port
clawvault dashboard --port 8080

# Specific vault
clawvault dashboard -v ~/work-vault
```

The dashboard opens at `http://localhost:3377` and displays the vault's knowledge graph with typed nodes, typed edges, and category statistics.
