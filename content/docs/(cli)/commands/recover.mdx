title: "recover"
description: "Detect context death and restore checkpoint/handoff context"
---

The `recover` command checks whether the previous session exited cleanly and, if not, restores the latest checkpoint and handoff context.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault recover [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--clear` | Clear the dirty death flag after recovery | false |
| `--verbose` | Show full checkpoint and handoff content | false |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--json` | Output as JSON | false |

## Examples

```bash
# Check for context death
clawvault recover

# Recover and clear the dirty flag
clawvault recover --clear

# Full recovery details as JSON
clawvault recover --verbose --json
```

## Details

Recovery inspects the dirty-death flag and latest checkpoint metadata, then looks for the newest handoff in `handoffs/`. In normal workflows, `recover` runs automatically as part of `wake`; direct use is most helpful for debugging or automation.
