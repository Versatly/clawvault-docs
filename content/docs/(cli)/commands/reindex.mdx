The `reindex` command rebuilds the keyword search index from scratch. Optionally updates qmd embeddings for semantic (vector) search.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault reindex [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |
| `--qmd` | Also update qmd embeddings | false |

## Examples

```bash
# Rebuild keyword index
clawvault reindex

# Rebuild everything including vector embeddings
clawvault reindex --qmd
```

Run `reindex` after bulk imports, manual file edits, or if search results seem stale.
