The `project` command introduces a first-class project primitive to ClawVault. Projects are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `projects/` and link to tasks, team members, and clients.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault project <subcommand> [options]
```

## Subcommands

### `project add`

Create a new project.

```bash
clawvault project add "Site Machine" \
  --owner pedro \
  --client "Hale Pet Door" \
  --team "pedro,clawdious,joao" \
  --status active \
  --deadline 2026-03-01 \
  --repo "https://github.com/Versatly/site-machine" \
  --tags "client,priority" \
  --description "E-commerce site rebuild"
```

```bash
clawvault project show site-machine
clawvault project show site-machine --json
```

### `project tasks`

List all tasks linked to a project (via `project` field in task frontmatter).

```bash
clawvault project tasks site-machine
clawvault project tasks site-machine --json
```

### `project board`

Generate an Obsidian-compatible Kanban board for all projects.

```bash
clawvault project board
clawvault project board --group-by client
clawvault project board --output ~/vault/Projects-Board.md
```

| `--group-by <field>` | Group by `status`, `owner`, or `client` | status |

## Linking Tasks to Projects

When creating tasks, use the `--project` flag to associate them:

```bash
clawvault task add "Rebuild product pages" --project site-machine --owner joao
```

Then `clawvault project tasks site-machine` shows all linked tasks.

## File Structure

Projects are stored in `projects/` as markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
