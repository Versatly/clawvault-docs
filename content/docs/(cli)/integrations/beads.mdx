[Beads](https://github.com/impredicative/bd) (`bd`) is a command-line personal knowledge and task management tool. ClawVault can optionally sync active task information from beads into your vault's compiled views.

## How It Works

The `sync-bd` command queries your local `bd` installation for active tasks and writes them into the `views/now.md` file under an **Active Tasks (from bd)** section. This gives your AI agent visibility into what you are currently working on outside of ClawVault sessions.

The sync is **additive** — it upserts the task section without disturbing other content in `views/now.md`.

## Requirements

- The `bd` binary must be installed and available on your `PATH`
- If `bd` is not found, `sync-bd` exits silently with no error

<Callout type="info">
  Beads integration is entirely optional. ClawVault checks for the `bd` binary at runtime and skips the sync if it is not installed.
</Callout>

## Usage

```bash
# Sync active bd tasks into views/now.md
clawvault sync-bd

# Preview without writing
clawvault sync-bd --dry-run
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be synced without writing | false |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |

## Output

After running `sync-bd`, your `views/now.md` will contain a section like:

```markdown
## Active Tasks (from bd)
- Review Q4 planning doc
- Ship clawvault v2.2.0
- Update onboarding flow
```

Tasks with a status of `done`, `completed`, or `closed` are excluded automatically.

## Automation

If you use the OpenClaw hook, you can add `sync-bd` to your heartbeat or session-start workflow so that task context stays current without manual invocation. See the [OpenClaw hook setup](/integrations/openclaw/hook-setup) guide for details.
