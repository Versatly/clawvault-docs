title: "Installation"
---

Use this as the canonical setup path for ClawVault + OpenClaw.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- `qmd` installed and available on `PATH` (`qmd --version`)

ClawVault currently relies on qmd for core query and context workflows.

## 1) Install ClawVault CLI

```bash
npm install -g clawvault
clawvault --version
```

## 2) Initialize a Vault

```bash
clawvault init ~/memory --name my-brain --qmd-collection my-memory
clawvault setup --theme neural --canvas
```

Optional environment setup:

```bash
export CLAWVAULT_PATH="$HOME/memory"
```

## 3) OpenClaw Hook Setup (Canonical)

```bash
openclaw hooks install clawvault
openclaw hooks enable clawvault

# Verify discovery + eligibility + wiring
openclaw hooks list --verbose
openclaw hooks info clawvault
openclaw hooks check
clawvault compat
```

Restart your OpenClaw gateway process after installing/enabling hooks.

## Skill vs Hook (Important)

- `clawhub install clawvault` installs skill guidance into workspace flows.
- `openclaw hooks install clawvault` installs the runtime hook pack.
- `openclaw hooks enable clawvault` enables the hook entry in OpenClaw config.

For lifecycle automation (`gateway:startup`, `command:new`, `session:start`, etc.), you need the hook install/enable flow.

## AGENTS.md Guidance (Safe Change)

Keep your existing AGENTS instructions. Append a minimal ClawVault block:

```markdown
## ClawVault
- Run `clawvault wake` at session start.
- Run `clawvault checkpoint` during heavy work.
- Run `clawvault sleep "summary" --next "next steps"` at session end.
- Use `clawvault context "<task>"` before complex planning/execution.
```

Do not replace your whole AGENTS.md unless you intentionally want to.

## Shell Integration (Optional)

```bash
eval "$(clawvault shell-init)"
```

Current aliases added by shell-init:

- `cvwake` -> `clawvault wake`
- `cvsleep` -> `clawvault sleep`
- `cvcheck` -> `clawvault doctor`

## Troubleshooting

### `openclaw hooks enable clawvault` fails (hook not found)

```bash
openclaw hooks install clawvault
openclaw hooks list --verbose
```

OpenClaw discovers hooks by precedence:
1. workspace hooks (`<workspace>/hooks/`)
2. managed hooks (`~/.openclaw/hooks/`)
3. bundled hooks

If a same-named hook exists in workspace hooks, it can shadow the managed hook.

### qmd issues

```bash
qmd --version
clawvault doctor
```

### Validate integration state

```bash
clawvault compat --strict
```
