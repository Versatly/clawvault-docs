# ClawHub

[ClawHub](https://clawhub.dev) is the skill marketplace for OpenClaw. ClawVault is distributed as a ClawHub skill, which means installing it, updating it, and sharing your configuration is handled through the standard skill lifecycle.

## Installing from ClawHub

```bash
openclaw skill install clawvault
```

This downloads the ClawVault skill, installs the CLI, and registers the OpenClaw hook. After installation, run setup:

```bash
clawvault setup
```

The setup wizard detects your OpenClaw environment and configures the vault path, hook integration, and default settings.

## Publishing as a Skill

If you have built extensions or customizations on top of ClawVault, you can publish them as a separate skill:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create the skill manifest

Every ClawHub skill needs a `SKILL.md` and a `skill.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "clawvault-custom",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Custom ClawVault configuration with team-specific templates",
  "dependencies": ["clawvault"],
  "hooks": {
    "post-install": "setup.sh"
  }
}
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Write the SKILL.md

Document what your skill does, how to configure it, and any requirements. This file is displayed on the ClawHub listing page.
</Step>
<Step>
### Publish

```bash
openclaw skill publish
```

This validates the skill manifest, runs audit checks, and uploads to ClawHub.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Skill Metadata

The `skill.json` manifest supports the following fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique skill identifier |
| `version` | Yes | Semver version string |
| `description` | Yes | Short description for the listing |
| `dependencies` | No | Other skills this skill requires |
| `hooks` | No | Lifecycle hooks (post-install, pre-update, etc.) |
| `compatibility` | No | Minimum OpenClaw version required |
| `author` | No | Author name or organization |
| `license` | No | SPDX license identifier |

## Audit Requirements

Before a skill is listed publicly on ClawHub, it must pass automated audits:

- **No secrets** -- the skill must not contain API keys, tokens, or credentials
- **Valid manifest** -- `skill.json` must parse correctly with all required fields
- **Hook safety** -- hook scripts are scanned for dangerous operations (rm -rf, curl to unknown hosts, etc.)
- **Dependency resolution** -- all declared dependencies must exist on ClawHub

```bash
# Run the audit locally before publishing
openclaw skill audit
```

<Callout type="warn">
Skills that fail audit are rejected from the public registry. Fix all warnings before publishing. Private skills (team-only) have relaxed audit requirements.
</Callout>

## Version Management

ClawHub uses semantic versioning. To update a published skill:

```bash
# Bump version in skill.json, then:
openclaw skill publish
```

Users on older versions receive update notifications:

```bash
openclaw skill update clawvault
```

To pin a specific version:

```bash
openclaw skill install clawvault@2.1.0
```

### Breaking Changes

When publishing a major version bump (e.g., 1.x to 2.x), ClawHub flags it as a breaking change. Users must explicitly opt in to major upgrades:

```bash
openclaw skill update clawvault --major
```
