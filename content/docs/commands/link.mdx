# clawvault link

The `link` command automatically converts entity mentions into wiki-links (`[[entity]]`) and helps you manage the relationships between your memory files.

## Usage

```bash
# Link all files in the vault
clawvault link --all

# Link a specific file
clawvault link memory/2024-01-15.md

# Show what links to a specific file
clawvault link --backlinks people/pedro.md

# Find broken wiki-links
clawvault link --orphans
```

## Commands

### Auto-link All Files

```bash
clawvault link --all
```

Scans all markdown files in your vault and automatically converts entity mentions into wiki-links:

- **People:** `Pedro` → `[[pedro]]`
- **Projects:** `ClawVault` → `[[clawvault]]` 
- **Decisions:** `database choice` → `[[database-choice]]`

The linking process is smart about context and avoids linking common words or inappropriate mentions.

### Link Specific File

```bash
clawvault link path/to/file.md
```

Process a single file for entity mentions and convert them to wiki-links.

### Show Backlinks

```bash
clawvault link --backlinks target-file.md
```

Display all files that link to the specified target file. Useful for understanding relationships and finding related context.

**Example output:**
```
Backlinks to people/pedro.md:
 decisions/2024-01-10-hiring.md:5 "discussed with [[pedro]]"
 projects/clawvault.md:12 "[[pedro]] suggested the graph approach"
 memory/2024-01-15.md:23 "meeting with [[pedro]] about roadmap"
```

### Find Orphaned Links

```bash
clawvault link --orphans
```

Identify broken wiki-links that reference files that don't exist. This helps maintain vault integrity and find content that needs to be created.

**Example output:**
```
Orphaned links found:
 memory/2024-01-10.md:15 [[client-onboarding]] → people/client-onboarding.md (missing)
 decisions/database.md:8 [[performance-tests]] → projects/performance-tests.md (missing)

Suggestions:
 - Create missing files, or
 - Remove/rename links to existing content
```

## Entity Detection

The linking system recognizes several types of entities:

### People
- Proper names in people/ folder or mentioned in context
- Converts to slug format: `John Smith` → `[[john-smith]]`

### Projects 
- Project names from projects/ folder
- Technology/tool names mentioned frequently
- Converts to kebab-case: `Pet Door App` → `[[pet-door-app]]`

### Decisions
- Decision titles from decisions/ folder
- Choice-related phrases in context

## Wiki-Link Format

ClawVault uses standard Obsidian-style wiki-links:

```markdown
# Basic link
[[entity-name]]

# Link with display text 
[[entity-name|Display Text]]

# Link to specific section
[[entity-name#section]]
```

## Entity Routing

When you create a link to an entity that doesn't exist, ClawVault follows smart routing rules:

- `[[person-name]]` → `people/person-name.md`
- `[[project-name]]` → `projects/project-name.md`
- `[[decision-title]]` → `decisions/decision-title.md`

For people and projects, files may be routed to subfolders:
- `[[pedro]]` → `people/pedro/index.md` or `people/pedro.md`

## Best Practices

<Callout type="info">
1. **Run `--all` periodically** to catch new entity mentions
2. **Check `--orphans` monthly** to clean up broken links
3. **Use descriptive entity names** that won't conflict with common words
4. **Link liberally** — over-linking is better than under-linking
</Callout>

### When to Link
- **Names of people** you interact with
- **Project names** and major tools/technologies 
- **Key decisions** that might be referenced later
- **Important concepts** that appear across multiple files

### When NOT to Link
- Common words like "the", "and", "with"
- Obvious context that doesn't need connection
- Temporary or one-off mentions

## Integration with Memory Graph

Wiki-links are a primary source of edges in your [memory graph](/concepts/memory-graph/). The `clawvault graph` command uses these links to build relationship maps and improve context retrieval.

```bash
# Refresh graph after major linking changes
clawvault graph --refresh
```

## Examples

### Auto-linking in Practice

**Before linking:**
```markdown
Met with Pedro today about the ClawVault improvements. 
He suggested we focus on the memory graph feature first.
We decided to use the graph approach for better context.
```

**After `clawvault link --all`:**
```markdown
Met with [[pedro]] today about the [[clawvault]] improvements.
He suggested we focus on the memory graph feature first.
We [[decision-graph-approach|decided to use the graph approach]] for better context.
```

### Finding Orphans

```bash
$ clawvault link --orphans

 Orphaned Wiki-Links Found:

memory/2024-01-10.md:
 Line 15: [[client-onboarding]] → people/client-onboarding.md (missing)
 Line 23: [[api-design]] → decisions/api-design.md (missing)

Total: 2 orphaned links in 1 file

 Suggestions:
 - Create people/client-onboarding.md for client process documentation
 - Create decisions/api-design.md for API architecture decisions
 - Or update links to point to existing files
```

<Callout>
Link processing is fast for most vaults. For very large vaults (1000+ files), consider linking specific files rather than using `--all` frequently.
