description: "Session lifecycle commands for starting and ending work with context continuity"
---

The `wake` and `sleep` commands are ClawVault's primary session lifecycle tools. They provide comprehensive context restoration at session start and rich handoff capture at session end.

## clawvault wake

**Start your session with full context recovery.**

```bash
clawvault wake [options]
```

### What Wake Does

1. **Checks for context death** and clears dirty flag
2. **Generates session recap** from recent handoffs
3. **Includes recent observations** (structural and potential importance) 
4. **Creates executive summary** (LLM-generated when available)

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--handoff-limit <n>` | Max recent handoffs to include | 3 |
| `--brief` | Compact format for token efficiency | true |
| `--no-summary` | Skip LLM executive summary generation | false |

### Example Output

```markdown
## Executive Summary

Continue auth refactor focusing on token validation. Critical blocker: API docs still missing from vendor. Sarah Chen needs update by EOD for client demo Friday.

## Recovery Status
**Context Death:** Detected at 14:32 (2 hours ago)
**Last Checkpoint:** fixing auth bug, token validation logic

## Recent Handoffs

### 2026-02-13 12:45
**Working on:** authentication system refactor 
**Next:** write integration tests, deploy staging
**Blocked:** waiting for OAuth provider documentation
**Feeling:** productive, code architecture is solid

## Recent Observations

### 2026-02-13
- 14:30 Auth token validation failing in edge cases
- 13:15 Client demo moved to Friday - need working auth by Thursday 
- 12:20 Sarah prefers Slack updates over email for urgent items

### 2026-02-12 
- 16:45 OAuth provider changed API, need new documentation
- 15:30 Redis session store performs 3x better than file-based
```

## clawvault sleep

**End your session with structured handoff.**

```bash
clawvault sleep <summary> [options]
```

### Required

- `<summary>` - What you were working on (comma-separated for multiple items)

### Options

| Flag | Description | Interactive Prompt |
|------|-------------|--------------------|
| `--next <items>` | Next steps to take | "Next steps (comma-separated):" |
| `--blocked <items>` | Current blockers | "Blocked items (comma-separated):" |
| `--decisions <items>` | Key decisions made | No prompt |
| `--questions <items>` | Open questions | No prompt |
| `--feeling <text>` | How the session felt | No prompt |
| `--no-git` | Skip git commit prompt | N/A |
| `--reflect` | Generate a reflection summary for the session | No prompt |
| `--session-transcript <path>` | Process session for observations | Auto-detected |

### Interactive Mode

When you don't provide `--next` or `--blocked`, sleep prompts interactively:

```bash
clawvault sleep "built user authentication"

# Prompts:
# Next steps (comma-separated, empty to skip): write tests, deploy staging
# Blocked items (comma-separated, empty to skip): waiting for API docs
# Git repo dirty (3 changes). Commit before sleep? (y/N): y 
# Commit message: Add JWT token validation
```

## Best Practices

1. ** Always wake** - Start every session with context recovery
2. ** Sleep clean** - End with clear next steps
3. ** Checkpoint often** - Use intermediate checkpoints during long sessions
4. ** Link entities** - Use `[[wiki-links]]` in handoff notes
5. ** Include feeling** - Mental state helps future context
