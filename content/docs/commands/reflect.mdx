import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

The `reflect` command analyzes recent observations and promotes stable patterns into weekly reflection files. Reflections distill day-level observations into higher-level summaries that persist longer than individual observations.

_Added in v2.2.0_

## Usage

```bash
clawvault reflect [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--days <n>` | Observation window in days | 14 |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be reflected without writing | false |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |

## How It Works

1. Scans observations from the last N days (default 14)
2. Identifies recurring themes, decisions, and patterns across multiple days
3. Writes weekly reflection files summarizing the promoted observations
4. Optionally runs an archive pass to move old observations past the retention window

<Callout type="info">
  Reflections are triggered automatically during `replay` operations. Manual invocation is useful when you want to force a reflection pass outside of the normal observation cycle.
</Callout>

## Examples

```bash
# Run reflection with default 14-day window
clawvault reflect

# Preview reflections without writing
clawvault reflect --dry-run

# Use a 30-day observation window
clawvault reflect --days 30

# Reflect against a specific vault
clawvault reflect -v ~/my-vault
```
