import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

The `rebuild` command reprocesses raw ledger transcripts to regenerate compiled observation files. Use this when you need to recompute observations after changes to the scoring system, observation format, or compression logic.

_Added in v2.2.0_

## Usage

```bash
clawvault rebuild [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--from <date>` | Start date (YYYY-MM-DD) | — |
| `--to <date>` | End date (YYYY-MM-DD) | — |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path | Nearest vault |

## How It Works

1. Lists all raw transcript files in the ledger, optionally filtered by date range
2. Deletes existing compiled observation files for each date
3. Replays each day's raw transcripts through the observer pipeline
4. Writes fresh compiled observation files

<Callout type="warn">
  Rebuild deletes and regenerates observation files. Raw transcripts in the ledger are preserved and never modified. If you want to preview the scope first, check the date range with `clawvault list` before running rebuild.
</Callout>

## Examples

```bash
# Rebuild all observations
clawvault rebuild

# Rebuild observations for a specific date range
clawvault rebuild --from 2026-01-01 --to 2026-01-31

# Rebuild against a specific vault
clawvault rebuild -v ~/my-vault
```
