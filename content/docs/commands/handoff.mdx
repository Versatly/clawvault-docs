The `handoff` command creates a structured handoff document capturing what you were working on, what's next, and any blockers. Handoffs are the core unit of session continuity in ClawVault.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault handoff [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-w, --working-on <items>` | What I was working on (comma-separated) |
| `-b, --blocked <items>` | What is blocked (comma-separated) |
| `-n, --next <items>` | What comes next (comma-separated) |
| `-d, --decisions <items>` | Key decisions made (comma-separated) |
| `-q, --questions <items>` | Open questions (comma-separated) |
| `-f, --feeling <state>` | Emotional/energy state |
| `-s, --session <key>` | Session key |
| `-v, --vault <path>` | Vault path |
| `--no-index` | Skip qmd index update |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

## Examples

```bash
# Full handoff
clawvault handoff \
  --working-on "auth refactor, API tests" \
  --next "deploy to staging, write integration tests" \
  --blocked "waiting for OAuth docs" \
  --decisions "chose JWT over session cookies" \
  --feeling "productive"

# Quick handoff with just the essentials
clawvault handoff -w "bug fix for login" -n "test and deploy"

# JSON output for automation
clawvault handoff -w "migration" --json
```

<Callout type="info">
  `clawvault sleep` calls `handoff` internally with additional features like git commit prompts and interactive mode. Use `handoff` directly when you want programmatic control or are building automation.
</Callout>

## Handoff vs Sleep

| | `handoff` | `sleep` |
|---|-----------|---------|
| Interactive prompts | No | Yes |
| Git commit prompt | No | Yes |
| Auto-observe | No | Yes |
| Use case | Scripting, automation | End-of-session ritual |
