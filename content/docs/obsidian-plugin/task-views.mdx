# Task Views

ClawVault tasks are markdown files with frontmatter. Combined with Obsidian's Bases feature (1.12+), you get database-like views over your tasks.

## Included Base Files

The plugin can generate `.base` files for common task views. Use the command palette: **ClawVault: Generate Task Bases**.

### All Tasks

Shows every task with columns for status, priority, project, and dates.

```yaml
# tasks-all.base
filter:
  - file.inFolder("tasks")
properties:
  - { name: status, type: text }
  - { name: priority, type: text }
  - { name: project, type: text }
  - { name: created, type: date }
  - { name: updated, type: date }
views:
  - type: table
    name: All Tasks
    groupBy: status
```

### By Project

Tasks grouped by project — see what's active per workstream.

### Blocked Items

Filtered to only `status: blocked` tasks, showing `blocked_by` field prominently.

### Backlog

Everything in `backlog/` sorted by project, ready to promote.

## File Explorer Decorations

The plugin adds visual indicators in the file explorer:

- `●` — in-progress tasks
- `○` — open tasks
- `⊘` — blocked tasks (red)
- `✓` — completed tasks (green)
- `📥` — inbox items

## Requirements

Task views use Obsidian Bases, which requires Obsidian 1.12 or later. The file explorer decorations work on all supported versions.
