# Sidebar Panel

The ClawVault sidebar panel shows a live overview of your vault.

## Opening the Panel

- Click the elephant icon (🐘) in the left ribbon
- Or use the command palette: **ClawVault: Open Status Panel**

## What It Shows

```

### Sections

- **Vault summary** — file count, graph node/edge count from `.clawvault/graph-index.json`
- **Tasks** — counts by status (open, active, blocked, done) with completion percentage
- **Inbox** — number of unprocessed items in `inbox/`
- **Observations** — when the last observation ran, total count
- **Reflections** — latest weekly reflection date

## Auto-Refresh

The panel refreshes automatically based on the interval you set in settings (default: 60 seconds). It also refreshes when you switch files or save.

## Clicking Items

Task counts and inbox counts are clickable — they open a filtered file list showing just those items.
