# Tailscale Sync

ClawVault vaults can share data over your Tailscale network. Multiple agents on different machines can search each other's vaults, forward observations, and maintain shared context.

## How It Works

Each machine runs `clawvault serve` which starts an HTTP API bound to the Tailscale IP (`100.x.x.x`). Only devices on your Tailnet can reach it.

```bash
# Start the vault server
clawvault serve
# → Listening on 100.64.31.68:7283
```

## Discovering Peers

```bash
# List known vault peers
clawvault peers

# Add a peer
clawvault peers add eli-mac --host 100.70.233.52 --trust read
```

### Trust Levels

| Level | What It Allows |
|-------|---------------|
| `read` | Search and read vault files |
| `read-write` | Read + write observations |
| `full` | Full vault access |

## Cross-Vault Search

Search across all connected vaults:

```bash
clawvault net-search "database migration decision"
```

Results show which vault each result comes from, with relevance scores.

## Observation Forwarding

When an agent observes a conversation that mentions entities in another vault, the observation can be forwarded automatically. The receiving vault stores it in `ledger/observations/` with attribution.

## Security

- Server binds to Tailscale IP only — never exposed to the public internet
- Optional bearer token authentication
- Trust levels control what each peer can do
- No data leaves your Tailnet
