# Canvas Dashboard

`clawvault canvas` generates an Obsidian JSON Canvas file that serves as a visual dashboard for your entire vault.

## Generating

From the command palette: **ClawVault: Generate Dashboard**

Or from the CLI:
```bash
clawvault canvas
```

This creates `dashboard.canvas` in your vault root. Open it in Obsidian to see the full visual layout.

## What's on the Dashboard

### Knowledge Graph Summary
- Total nodes, edges, and files
- Top entities by connection count
- Recent decisions

### Vault Activity Stats
- Observation count and date range
- Reflection count and latest week
- Task completion rate
- Document counts by category

### Active Tasks
File nodes for each active task — **click to open the task file directly**. Colored by priority:
- Red: critical/blocked
- Orange: high priority
- Gold: medium priority
- Default: low priority

### Blocked Items
Red group showing blocked tasks with their `blocked_by` references.

### Backlog Queue
Gray group with backlog items, grouped by project.

### Data Flow
Visual diagram showing: Session → Observe → Score → Route → Reflect → Promote

## Auto-Refresh

The plugin can regenerate the dashboard on a schedule. Configure in Settings → ClawVault → Dashboard refresh interval.

## JSON Canvas Spec

The dashboard follows the [JSON Canvas specification](https://jsoncanvas.org/spec/1.0/). Node types used:
- **File nodes** — link directly to vault files (clickable)
- **Text nodes** — formatted stats and summaries
- **Group nodes** — visual sections with colored borders
- **Edges** — connections between related items
