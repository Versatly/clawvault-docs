# Mobile Sync

Access your ClawVault vault on Obsidian mobile by syncing over your Tailscale network via WebDAV.

## Prerequisites

- `clawvault serve` running on your desktop/server
- Tailscale app installed on your phone (iOS or Android)
- Phone connected to the same Tailnet
- Obsidian mobile with the [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save) community plugin

## Setup

### 1. Start the Vault Server

On your desktop or server:

```bash
clawvault serve
# → Listening on 100.64.31.68:7283
# → WebDAV available at /webdav/
```

### 2. Install Tailscale on Your Phone

Download Tailscale from the App Store or Google Play. Sign in with the same account as your desktop.

### 3. Configure Remotely Save

In Obsidian mobile:

1. Install the **Remotely Save** community plugin
2. Open its settings
3. Choose **WebDAV** as the remote type
4. Set the server URL: `http://100.64.31.68:7283/webdav/`
5. Leave username/password blank (Tailscale network is the auth boundary)
6. Test the connection — should show success

### 4. Sync

Remotely Save can sync automatically on open/close, or manually via the command palette.

## What Syncs

Everything in your vault syncs bidirectionally:

- Tasks and backlog items
- Decisions, lessons, people files
- Observations and reflections
- Dashboard canvas
- Templates

The `.clawvault/` internal directory and `.git/` are excluded from WebDAV for security.

## Editing on Mobile

You can:
- View and edit any vault file
- Open the canvas dashboard
- Browse the knowledge graph
- Read observations and reflections

Creating new tasks or capturing notes on mobile syncs back to your desktop vault on next sync.

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't connect**: Verify both devices are on the same Tailnet (`tailscale status`)
- **Sync conflicts**: Remotely Save handles conflicts by keeping both versions
- **Slow sync**: Large vaults may take a moment on first sync. Subsequent syncs are incremental.
