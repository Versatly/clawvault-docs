# Graph Colors

The plugin colors nodes in Obsidian's graph view based on their vault category and tags.

## Default Color Scheme

| Category | Color | Hex |
|----------|-------|-----|
| tasks | Gold | `#e8a430` |
| decisions | Red | `#e85d4a` |
| people | Blue | `#4a90e8` |
| projects | Green | `#4ae85d` |
| lessons | Purple | `#9b59b6` |
| backlog | Gray | `#95a5a6` |
| commitments | Orange | `#e67e22` |
| research | Teal | `#1abc9c` |
| inbox | Light gray | `#bdc3c7` |

Blocked tasks (frontmatter `status: blocked`) get bright red (`#e74c3c`) regardless of category.

## Customization

Open Settings → ClawVault → Graph Colors to change any category's color.

Colors are applied via CSS injection — the plugin reads your `.clawvault.json` categories and generates the appropriate styles.

## How It Works

Obsidian's graph view uses file paths to identify nodes. The plugin maps folder paths to colors:

- `tasks/my-task.md` → gold node
- `decisions/use-postgres.md` → red node
- `people/pedro.md` → blue node

Files in the vault root or unrecognized folders use the default Obsidian node color.

## Tag-Based Overrides

You can also color nodes by tag. Add tag→color mappings in settings:

- `#urgent` → bright red
- `#archived` → dim gray
- `#milestone` → gold

Tag colors take priority over category colors when both apply.
