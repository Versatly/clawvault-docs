# Customization

The ClawVault plugin is designed to be configurable out of the box.

## Settings

Open Settings → ClawVault to configure:

### Graph Colors

Per-category color pickers with live preview. Change any category's graph node color. Reset to defaults with one click.

### Auto-Refresh

How often the sidebar panel refreshes vault stats. Default: 60 seconds. Set to 0 to disable auto-refresh.

### Status Bar

Toggle the bottom status bar item on/off. When enabled, shows node count and active task count.

### Vault Path

Usually auto-detected from `.clawvault.json`. Override if your vault is in a non-standard location.

## CSS Snippets

The plugin injects CSS for graph coloring, but you can add your own snippets in `.obsidian/snippets/`:

```css
/* Custom: make blocked tasks pulse */
.graph-view .node[data-status="blocked"] {
  animation: pulse 2s infinite;
}

@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0.5; }
}
```

```css
/* Custom: larger task nodes in graph */
.graph-view .node[data-category="tasks"] {
  r: 8;
}
```

## Custom Categories

If you've added custom categories beyond the defaults, the plugin picks them up from `.clawvault.json`. Add colors for them in Settings → Graph Colors.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Assign hotkeys to any ClawVault command in Settings → Hotkeys:

- `ClawVault: Quick Capture` — suggested: `Ctrl+Shift+C`
- `ClawVault: Add Task` — suggested: `Ctrl+Shift+T`
- `ClawVault: Generate Dashboard` — suggested: `Ctrl+Shift+D`
