# Commands

The plugin registers commands in Obsidian's command palette (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`).

## Available Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Quick Capture** | Opens a modal to capture a thought, saves to `inbox/` |
| **Refresh Stats** | Force-refresh the sidebar panel |
| **Open Status Panel** | Opens the sidebar panel |

## Quick Capture

The capture modal is a single text field. Type your thought and press Enter. The plugin creates a markdown file in `inbox/` with:

```markdown
---
title: "Your thought"
date: 2026-02-14
type: fact
---

# Your thought

Your thought text here.
```

## Task Management

Tasks are managed through Kanban boards (`Board.md`) and Obsidian Bases (`.base` files), not through plugin commands. Use the CLI:

```bash
clawvault task add "Title" --priority high --project my-project
clawvault kanban sync
```

The plugin's sidebar panel shows task counts from the vault, but creation and updates go through the CLI or by editing task files directly.
