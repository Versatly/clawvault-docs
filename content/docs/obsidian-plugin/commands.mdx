# Commands

The plugin registers commands in Obsidian's command palette (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`).

## Available Commands

| Command | What It Does | Requires CLI |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Generate Dashboard** | Runs `clawvault canvas` and opens the `.canvas` file | Yes |
| **Quick Capture** | Opens a modal to capture a thought → saves to `inbox/` | No |
| **Add Task** | Modal with title, project, priority → saves to `tasks/` | No |
| **View Blocked** | Modal listing all blocked tasks with blocker info | No |
| **Refresh Stats** | Force-refresh the sidebar panel | No |
| **Open Status Panel** | Opens the sidebar panel | No |

## Quick Capture

The capture modal is a single text field. Type your thought and press Enter. The plugin creates a markdown file in `inbox/` with:

```markdown
---
title: "Your thought"
date: 2026-02-14
type: fact
---

# Your thought

Your thought text here.
```

## Add Task

The task modal has three fields:

- **Title** (required) — becomes the filename and heading
- **Project** (optional) — links to a project via wiki-link
- **Priority** (optional) — critical, high, medium, low

Creates a file in `tasks/` with proper frontmatter:

```markdown
---
status: open
created: '2026-02-14T08:00:00.000Z'
updated: '2026-02-14T08:00:00.000Z'
project: my-project
priority: high
---

# Build the thing

[[my-project]]
```

## Desktop Only

Commands that run the ClawVault CLI (Generate Dashboard) are desktop-only. On mobile, these commands show a notice explaining they require the CLI.

File-creating commands (Quick Capture, Add Task) work on all platforms since they write directly.
