# Obsidian Plugin

The ClawVault Obsidian plugin brings your vault to life with visual management features.

## What It Does

- **Colored knowledge graph** — nodes colored by category (decisions in red, people in blue, tasks in gold)
- **Sidebar status panel** — vault stats at a glance
- **Command palette** — capture notes and run vault commands without leaving Obsidian
- **Mobile sync** — sync your vault to Obsidian mobile over Tailscale via WebDAV
- **Customizable templates** — every vault category has configurable templates for new files

Task management lives in Kanban boards and `.base` files — the plugin focuses on vault visualization and status.

## Requirements

- Obsidian 1.5.0 or later
- ClawVault CLI installed (`npm i -g clawvault`)
- A ClawVault vault (run `clawvault init` to create one)

## Quick Start

1. Install the plugin from Obsidian Community Plugins
2. Open a vault that has been initialized with `clawvault init`
3. The plugin auto-detects `.clawvault.json` and activates

Your graph nodes will be colored immediately. Open the sidebar panel to see vault stats.

## Architecture

The plugin reads your vault's local files — no cloud, no network calls (except optional Tailscale sync). Everything stays on your machine.

```
.clawvault.json              -> Plugin reads vault config
.clawvault/graph-index.json  -> Graph stats and node data
tasks/                       -> Task files with YAML frontmatter
Board.md                     -> Kanban board (managed by clawvault kanban sync)
*.base                       -> Obsidian Bases database views
```
