# Installation

## From Community Plugins

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to **Community Plugins** and disable Safe Mode if prompted
3. Click **Browse** and search for "ClawVault"
4. Click **Install**, then **Enable**

## Manual Installation

Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/Versatly/obsidian-clawvault/releases):

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`
2. Create a folder: `.obsidian/plugins/clawvault/`
3. Copy the three files into that folder
4. Restart Obsidian and enable the plugin in Settings → Community Plugins

## Prerequisites

The plugin works best with the ClawVault CLI installed:

```bash
npm install -g clawvault
```

Without the CLI, visual features (graph colors, sidebar stats) still work. Commands that generate files (dashboard, quick capture) require the CLI.

## First Run

When the plugin loads, it looks for `.clawvault.json` in your vault root. If found:

- Graph colors are applied automatically
- Sidebar panel becomes available (click the elephant icon)
- Status bar shows node and task counts
- Commands are registered in the command palette

If no `.clawvault.json` is found, initialize your vault:

```bash
clawvault init /path/to/your/obsidian/vault
```

## Updating

The plugin auto-updates through Obsidian's plugin manager. For manual updates, replace the three files in `.obsidian/plugins/clawvault/`.
