# clawvault doctor

The `doctor` command performs a comprehensive health check on your ClawVault installation and vault state. It's your first line of defense when something feels wrong.

## Usage

```bash
clawvault doctor
```

## What It Inspects

The doctor command analyzes multiple aspects of your ClawVault setup:

### Vault Structure
- ✅ Vault directory exists and is accessible
- ✅ Required folders (`decisions/`, `lessons/`, `people/`, etc.) are present
- ✅ `.clawvault/` internal directory structure is intact
- ⚠️ Missing category folders (auto-created if needed)

### Configuration Health
- ✅ `CLAWVAULT_PATH` environment variable validity
- ✅ Vault configuration file (`.clawvault/config.json`)
- ✅ Graph index integrity (`.clawvault/graph-index.json`)
- ⚠️ Outdated configuration schema

### OpenClaw Integration
- ✅ Hook installation status (`openclaw hooks list`)
- ✅ Event routing compatibility
- ✅ Session transcript access permissions
- ⚠️ Hook handler safety checks
- ❌ Missing OpenClaw home directory

### Dependencies
- ✅ `qmd` availability for semantic search
- ✅ Node.js version compatibility
- ⚠️ Optional dependencies missing

### Data Integrity
- ✅ Checkpoint file validity
- ✅ Session continuity markers
- ✅ Graph index consistency with vault files
- ❌ Corrupted or orphaned files

## Example Output

```bash
$ clawvault doctor

**Fix:** Run the suggested command to enable the ClawVault hook.

### Missing qmd
```
⚠️ qmd: not found (semantic search disabled)
```
**Fix:** Install qmd: `npm install -g qmd`

### Outdated Graph Index
```
⚠️ Graph index: 3 days old, recommend refresh
```
**Fix:** Run `clawvault graph --refresh`

### Vault Path Issues

## When to Use Doctor

:::tip When to Run Doctor
- After installing or updating ClawVault
- When search results seem incomplete or wrong
- Before important sessions or presentations
- When you suspect context death isn't being detected
- After system updates or environment changes
:::

:::note Integration with compat
The `doctor` command includes a summary of `clawvault compat` results. For detailed OpenClaw compatibility diagnostics, run `clawvault compat --strict`.
:::

## Exit Codes

- `0` - All checks passed (healthy)
- `1` - Some issues found (needs attention)
- `2` - Critical issues found (broken)

The doctor command is safe to run repeatedly and never modifies your vault data.
