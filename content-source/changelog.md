# Changelog

## [2.5.3] — 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Consolidated setup guidance into one canonical OpenClaw runtime path (`hooks install` + `hooks enable` + explicit verification).
- Removed CLI/docs drift across installation, compat, context, wake/sleep, graph, qmd integration, and OpenClaw lifecycle docs.
- Clarified skill-vs-hook distinction and added direct troubleshooting for hook discovery precedence conflicts.

### Changed
- Updated command references to match current runtime flags/options (`compat --json`, `graph --json`, `context --max-hops`, `sleep --session`).
- Simplified docs content to executable workflows and removed speculative/undocumented flags and config keys.
- Added safer AGENTS.md guidance: append ClawVault instructions instead of replacing existing prompt/bootstrap behavior.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Memory Graph Index** — typed knowledge graph (`.clawvault/graph-index.json`) with wiki-link, tag, and frontmatter edges. Schema versioned with incremental rebuild.
- **Graph-Aware Context** — `clawvault context` now blends semantic search with graph-neighbor traversal, with explain signals in JSON output.
- **Context Profiles** — `clawvault context --profile <name>` with `default`, `planning`, `incident`, `handoff` presets for task-appropriate context injection.
- **`clawvault compat`** — OpenClaw compatibility diagnostics. Checks hook wiring, event routing, SKILL.md, and handler safety. `--strict` mode for CI.
- **`clawvault graph`** — Graph summary and refresh diagnostics.
- **Doctor upgrade** — now includes OpenClaw compatibility check summary.
- **Dashboard upgrades** — vault parser emits typed nodes, typed edges, and type statistics.
- **Hook handler** — flexible event routing via `eventMatches()` and `normalizeEventToken()`, `--profile auto` for context queries.

### Changed
- **CLI modularized** — monolithic `clawvault.js` split into 7 command groups (`register-core`, `register-query`, `register-vault-operations`, `register-maintenance`, `register-resilience`, `register-session-lifecycle`, `register-template`).
- **367+ tests** across core, commands, graph, dashboard, hooks, and CLI registration.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Entity-slug routing** — People/project observations now route to entity subfolders (`people/pedro/2026-02-12.md` instead of `people/2026-02-12.md`)
- **Root-level file prevention** — Observations never create files at vault root; always route to category folders
- **Entity name extraction** — Case-sensitive proper noun matching prevents capturing common words as entity names
- **Dedup improvements** — Router uses normalized content + Jaccard similarity to prevent duplicate entries

### Changed
- Router `appendToCategory` now resolves entity-aware file paths for people and projects categories
- Updated router tests to validate entity-slug subfolder structure

---

## [1.11.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Compressor priority enforcement** — Post-processes LLM output to upgrade misclassified priorities (decisions→🔴, preferences→🟡)
- **Temporal decay in reflector** — 🟢 observations older than 7 days auto-pruned; 🔴 always kept
- **Exec summary in wake** — Wake command now shows richer context with observation summaries
- **Dedup normalization** — Strips timestamps, wiki-links, and whitespace before comparing for duplicates

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-11

### Removed
- **Cloud sync** — Removed entire `src/cloud/` module (client, config, queue, service, types)
- **`clawvault cloud` command** — Removed cloud sync CLI command
- All cloud-related dependencies and imports stripped

### Philosophy
- ClawVault is now fully local-first. Zero network calls except optional LLM API for observe compression.
- Local folder sync (`vault.sync()`) remains for Obsidian cross-platform workflows.

---

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Path validation** - OPENCLAW_HOME and OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR now properly validated (trimmed, require absolute paths)
- **Error handling** - `listAgents()` now wrapped in try/catch to handle malformed filesystem state gracefully

---

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **OPENCLAW_HOME support** - Session utilities now respect the `OPENCLAW_HOME` environment variable for custom OpenClaw installations
- **OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR support** - Also supports `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` for overriding state/agent paths

### Compatibility
- Verified compatibility with OpenClaw v2026.2.9
- Hook handler confirmed working after OpenClaw's tsdown migration fix (#9295)
- Session transcript reading benefits from OpenClaw's parentId chain fix (#12283)

---

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-06

### Security
- **Fixed shell injection vulnerability** in hooks/clawvault/handler.js
  - Changed from `execSync` (with shell) to `execFileSync` (no shell)
  - All arguments passed as array, never interpolated into shell string
  - Vault path validation: must be absolute, exist, and contain .clawvault.json

- **Fixed prompt injection vulnerability**
  - Checkpoint recovery data now sanitized before injection
  - Control characters stripped, markdown escaped, length limited
  - Session keys and command sources sanitized with strict allowlist

- **Removed direct GitHub dependency** for qmd
  - qmd moved to optional peer dependency
  - Users install separately: `npm install -g github:tobi/qmd`
  - ClawVault gracefully handles missing qmd

### Changed
- Hook now validates vault paths before use
- Error messages in hooks are now generic (no sensitive data leaked)

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **`clawvault repair-session`** - Repair corrupted OpenClaw session transcripts
  - Detects orphaned `tool_result` blocks that reference non-existent `tool_use` IDs
  - Identifies aborted tool calls with partial JSON
  - Automatically relinks parent chain after removals
  - Creates backup before repair (configurable with `--no-backup`)
  - Dry-run mode with `--dry-run` to preview repairs
  - List sessions with `--list` flag
  - JSON output with `--json` for scripting
  
  **Problem solved:** When the Anthropic API rejects with "unexpected tool_use_id found in tool_result blocks", this command fixes the transcript so the session can continue without losing context.
  
  ```bash
  # Analyze without changing
  clawvault repair-session --dry-run
  
  # Repair current main session
  clawvault repair-session
  
  # Repair specific session
  clawvault repair-session --session <id> --agent <agent-id>
  ```

- **Session utilities** (`src/lib/session-utils.ts`)
  - `listAgents()` - Find all agents in ~/.openclaw/agents/
  - `findMainSession()` - Get current session for an agent
  - `findSessionById()` - Look up specific session
  - `getSessionFilePath()`, `backupSession()` - File helpers

### Tests
- Added 13 tests for session repair functionality
  - Transcript parsing
  - Tool use extraction from assistant messages
  - Corruption detection (aborted + orphaned)
  - Parent chain relinking
  - Dry-run mode
  - Backup creation

---

## [1.4.2] - 2026-02-06

### Added

  - `gateway:startup` event: Detects if previous session died, injects alert into first agent turn
  - `command:new` event: Auto-checkpoints before session reset
  - Install: `openclaw hooks install clawvault && openclaw hooks enable clawvault`
  - Hook ships with npm package via `openclaw.hooks` field in package.json

- **`clawvault wake`** - All-in-one session start command
  - Combines: `recover --clear` + `recap` + summary
  - Shows context death status, recent handoffs, what you were working on
  - Perfect for session startup ritual

- **`clawvault sleep <summary>`** - All-in-one session end command
  - Creates handoff with: --next, --blocked, --decisions, --questions, --feeling
  - Clears death flag
  - Optional git commit prompt (--no-git to skip)
  - Captures rich context before ending session

### Fixed
